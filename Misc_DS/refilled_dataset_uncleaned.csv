"BackgroundEmerging evidence in cancer neuroscience indicates that the nervous system interacts directly or indirectly with cancer cells, promoting tumor progression. The prostate gland contains an extensive neural network essential for regulating key physiological functions of prostate cells, and the significant neural distribution observed in prostate cancer highlights its critical role in driving cancer pathogenesis. Unfortunately, Comprehensive reviews systematically summarizing progress in cancer neuroscience for prostate cancer are currently lacking.MethodWe synthesize existing research on interactions between the nervous system and prostate cancer cells, explore the neural distribution within the prostate, and evaluate the impact of neural innervation on prostate cancer development and progression. Additionally, we also assess the potential neural regulation mechanisms in neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC).ResultWe found that neural interactions significantly influence prostate cancer development. Neural circuitry within the tumor microenvironment drives progression and contributes to the aggressiveness of lethal subtypes like NEPC. Targeting neuromodulation emerges as a promising therapeutic approach, potentially allowing the repurposing of established medications for treating advanced tumors.ConclusionNeuromodulation offers a promising therapeutic option for advanced prostate cancer, particularly NEPC, which faces limited treatment options. However, further research is necessary to fully understand the neural regulatory mechanisms involved in prostate cancer development and to identify new therapeutic targets and strategies for advanced stages.",Neuroscience,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1038/s41391-025-01042-y,0
"We provide a quantitative analysis of the philosophy-neuroscience nexus using citation analysis. Combining bibliometric indicators of cross-field visibility with journal citation mapping techniques, we investigate four dimensions of the nexus: how the visibility of neuroscience in philosophy and of philosophy in neuroscience has changed over time, which areas of philosophy are more interested in neuroscience, which areas of neuroscience are more interested in philosophy, and how the trading zone between the two fields is configured. We also discuss two hypotheses: the supposed occurrence of a neuro-revolution in philosophy and the role of psychology as the disciplinary link between neuroscience and philosophy. Both the visibility of neuroscience in philosophy and the visibility of philosophy in neuroscience have increased significantly from 1980 to 2020, albeit the latter remains an order of magnitude lower than the former. Neuroscience is particularly visible in philosophy of mind, applied ethics, philosophy of science, but not in ‘core’ areas of analytic philosophy. Philosophy is particularly visible in cognitive and systems neuroscience and neuropsychiatry, but not in biomedical neuroscience. As for the trading zone between philosophy and neuroscience, our data show that it works differently in philosophy and in neuroscience. While some philosophy journals are active loci of bidirectional communication, neuroscience journals are divided between journals ‘importing’ philosophy in neuroscience and journals ‘exporting’ neuroscience to philosophy. Lastly, data do not support the hypothesis that a widespread neuro-revolution has transformed philosophy radically, but support the hypothesis that psychology functions as a mediating disciplinary link between philosophy and neuroscience.",Neuroscience,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13194-024-00621-5,0
"The model organism approach in neuroscience promises to yield insights into the workings of the human brain and reveal general principles of nervous system structure and function. Yet its success depends on the representativeness of the model organisms studied. If model organisms are representative of species beyond themselves, they can provide a suitable basis for reliably extrapolating findings to humans and other organisms. However, model organism selection in neuroscience is rarely optimized for representativeness, and instead primarily reflects other considerations such as cost, convenience, and historical convention. This is especially true for model organisms repurposed from other scientific domains, where organisms are ported from one experimental context to another based on a previous track record of success combined with the availability of associated methods and research infrastructure. Consequently, many studies in neuroscience provide a weak foundation for extrapolation. After discussing this widespread issue in neuroscience, I suggest that the way forward involves more careful attention to comparative data and insights about biological evolution.",Neuroscience,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10539-025-09999-9,0
"IntroductionNeuroscience is a young discipline and an expanding field of study and research. The number of neuroscience postgraduate courses has risen much more rapidly than in any other field of biomedical research. However, from a scholarship perspective, the master's experience has been understudied. This work focuses on the answers given by a group of neuroscience alumni, a rarely examined academic cohort, to a straightforward question: ‘What is the most important lesson you learnt as a master's student?’.MethodsThematic analysis was performed on 27 entries hosted by a public-facing blog of a STEM-intense university across four academic years.ResultsFour themes emerged: Skills, Theoretical knowledge, Attitudes and Community. Beyond replicating previous findings on the importance of skills and theoretical knowledge, an ‘imbalance’ between them has been reported for the first time. What emerges in our work is the overwhelming importance the alumni place in attitudes, especially resilience, and in the social/community aspects of learning, along with the role played by fellow students, faculty and laboratory colleagues.DiscussionThe master's level can be the ideal one for increasing awareness of resilience and learning how to make the most of it. Institutions should consider strategies for strengthening informal learning and supporting the development of professional identities. These findings can be of interest to a wide range of neuroscience educators and provide useful insights for designing effective postgraduate training courses. Future works can investigate thehowbeyond thewhatand explore the roles played by attitudes, emotions and feelings across neuroscientists’ career stages.",Neuroscience,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12909-024-05970-6,0
"Proximity labeling (PL) techniques have advanced neuroscience by revealing the molecular interactions that govern neural circuits. From foundational tools such as BioID and APEX to recent innovations such as TurboID and light-activated systems, PL enables precise mapping of protein–protein interactions within living cells. Recent applications have identified dynamic protein networks in synaptic remodeling, calcium-dependent signaling and disease states, such as neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders. These studies not only deepen our comprehension of the molecular architecture of the brain but also uncover novel therapeutic targets. By integrating PL with cutting-edge multi-omics strategies and advanced imaging technologies, researchers can decode the intricate interplay between structural and functional neural networks. As PL technologies continue to evolve, they bridge molecular and cellular neuroscience, offering a useful framework for unraveling the complexity of brain networks. Here, in this Review, we underscore the potential of PL in neuroscience, furthering our understanding of the molecular basis of neural connectivity in both health and disease.",Neuroscience,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1038/s12276-025-01491-4,0

"Recently, a version of realism has been offered to address the simplification strategies used in computational neuroscience. According to this view, computational models provide us with knowledge about the brain, but they should not be taken literally inanysense, even rejecting the idea that the brain performs computations (computationalism). I acknowledge the need for considerations regarding simplification strategies in neuroscience and how they contribute to our interpretations of computational models; however, I argue that whether we should accept or reject computationalism about the brain is a separate issue that can be addressed independently by a philosophical theory of physical computation. This takes seriously the idea that the brain performs computations while also taking an analogical stance toward computational models in neuroscience. I call this version of realism “Analogical Computational Realism.” Analogical Computational Realism is a realist view in virtue of being committed to computationalism while taking certain computational models to pick out real patterns that provide a how-possibly explanation without also thinking that the model is literally implemented in the brain.",Neuroscience,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11229-025-04952-5,0
"Modern artificial intelligence (AI) models, such as large language models, are usually trained once on a huge corpus of data, potentially fine-tuned for a specific task and then deployed with fixed parameters. Their training is costly, slow and gradual, requiring billions of repetitions. In stark contrast, animals continuously adapt to the ever-changing contingencies in their environments. This is particularly important for social species, where behavioural policies and reward outcomes may frequently change in interaction with peers. The underlying computational processes are often marked by rapid shifts in an animal’s behaviour and rather sudden transitions in neuronal population activity. Such computational capacities are of growing importance for AI systems operating in the real world, like those guiding robots or autonomous vehicles, or for agentic AI interacting with humans online. Can AI learn from neuroscience? This Perspective explores this question, integrating the literature on continual and in-context learning in AI with the neuroscience of learning on behavioural tasks with shifting rules, reward probabilities or outcomes. We outline an agenda for how the links between neuroscience and AI could be tightened, thus supporting the transfer of ideas and findings between both areas and contributing to the evolving field of NeuroAI.",Neuroscience,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1038/s42256-025-01146-z,0
"Scientific discoveries often hinge on synthesizing decades of research, a task that potentially outstrips human information processing capacities. Large language models (LLMs) offer a solution. LLMs trained on the vast scientific literature could potentially integrate noisy yet interrelated findings to forecast novel results better than human experts. Here, to evaluate this possibility, we created BrainBench, a forward-looking benchmark for predicting neuroscience results. We find that LLMs surpass experts in predicting experimental outcomes. BrainGPT, an LLM we tuned on the neuroscience literature, performed better yet. Like human experts, when LLMs indicated high confidence in their predictions, their responses were more likely to be correct, which presages a future where LLMs assist humans in making discoveries. Our approach is not neuroscience specific and is transferable to other knowledge-intensive endeavours.",Neuroscience,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1038/s41562-024-02046-9,0
"Neuroimaging research on sex, gender, and sexuality is a growing field. Despite a plethora of criticisms from feminist scientists, science studies scholars, and philosophers, the dominant research framework is sex essentialist, which assumes that there are two biologically distinct human sexes. Drawing upon Intemann’s description of feminist standpoint empiricism, I develop a feminist standpoint framework for cognitive neuroscience using the neuroimaging of sex/gender differences as a case study. Feminist standpoint epistemology involves initiating inquiry from the lives of the oppressed, subordinate, marginalized, or neglected. By reflecting on the differences between the lived experiences of individuals from the dominant group as compared to those from nondominant groups, we can take those experiences into account and incorporate the interests of nondominant groups in the research. Revisions to scientific practice may involve changing: (1) the research question; (2) the experimental set-up, data collection, or analysis; or (3) the standards for the interpretation and dissemination of results. Adopting the feminist standpoint has the potential to create knowledge that may be more reliable and less narrow in scope and knowledge that is liberatory rather than oppressive.",Neuroscience,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11229-025-05106-3,0
"Educational neuroscience, an emerging interdisciplinary field, has yet to establish a unified conceptual framework that directly addresses the complexities of real-world learning. This perspective article critiques the field’s traditional reliance on decontextualized laboratory findings and animal models, arguing that such approaches fail to capture the inherently social and interactive nature of human education. It posits that a significant gap—a “bridge too far”—persists between fundamental neuroscience and educational practice. To bridge this gap, we advocate for a fundamental reorientation toward studying learning within authentic educational contexts, proposing interpersonal neural synchronization as a key methodology and biomarker. The article systematically reviews recent empirical evidence from real-world classroom settings, demonstrating how interpersonal neural synchronization can reveal the neural underpinnings of teacher-student rapport, knowledge construction, attention dynamics, and social-emotional bonding. We further illustrate the paradigm’s utility in challenging research contexts, including early childhood and special education. Ultimately, this article calls for educational neuroscience to move beyond its role as a mere “translator” of cognitive neuroscience and instead forge its own independent research paradigms. By embracing the social, interactive brain, the field can develop an authentic science of teaching and learning with direct implications for educational improvement.",Neuroscience,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s44436-025-00019-x,0
"Metacognition (the fundamental ability to reflect on and evaluate one’s own thoughts and actions) can shape human decisions and behaviours. Alterations in metacognition, such as distortions in confidence, self-reflection and beliefs about mental processes, are frequent in patients with mental disorders and are the target of effective clinical interventions. However, inconsistent frameworks and conceptual barriers between cognitive neuroscience and clinical disciplines have hindered advances in understanding and treating metacognition in psychopathology. In this Review, we review the metacognition literature to highlight cross-disciplinary inconsistencies and overlaps in terminology, experimental approaches and study populations between cognitive neuroscience and clinical perspectives. We build on a hierarchical framework of metacognition to start the process of integrating these literatures, and discuss the challenges associated with categorical and dimensional approaches to mental disorders. Our recommendations for future directions highlight the need for collaborative work between cognitive and clinical experts and methodological approaches that capture the causal links between metacognition and psychopathology.",Neuroscience,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1038/s44159-025-00503-4,0
"Neuroscience has emerged as a promising lens to uncover latent cognitive and emotional mechanisms underlying consumer behavior in marketing and sales. While its application in business-to-consumer (B2C) contexts has received growing scholarly attention, its relevance and potential contributions to business-to-business (B2B) sales remain underexplored and theoretically fragmented. Addressing this gap, our study asks: How has research on neuroscience in B2B selling evolved, and what key areas remain underdeveloped in both theory and practice? To answer this, we adopt a sequential mixed-methods design combining a systematic critical literature review with a Delphi study involving 18 internationally recognized B2B sales experts. Drawing from five leading academic databases—Web of Science, Scopus, PubMed, PsycINFO, and Google Scholar—we map current literature on the field. Findings reveal a reduced academic coverage, with neuroimaging techniques such as electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) offering insights into trust-building, engagement, and decision-making processes critical to B2B interactions. The Delphi study complements these insights by surfacing areas of expert consensus and divergence, particularly around ethical considerations, methodological limitations, and organizational barriers to adoption. Experts consistently call for the development of standardized protocols, cross-disciplinary frameworks, and empirical validation to enhance managerial relevance. Taken together, our findings position neuroscience as a potentially transformative—yet currently underutilized—paradigm for advancing B2B sales theory and practice. We conclude by outlining a future research agenda aimed at fostering methodological rigor, industry-specific applications, and broader contextual generalizability.",Neuroscience,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11301-025-00550-4,0

"Head and neck cancer (HNC) is an aggressive malignancy with significant effects on the innervation. Not only is it at the top of the cancer spectrum with a dismal prognosis, but it also imposes considerable stress on patients and society owing to frequent neurological symptoms. With progress in cancer neuroscience, the interactions between HNC and the nervous system, as well as the underlying mechanisms, have become increasingly clear. Compelling evidence suggests communication of information between cancer and nerve cells and devastation of the neurological system with tumor growth. However, the thorough grasp of HNC in cancer neuroscience has been severely constrained by the intricacy of HNC and fragmented research. This review comprehensively organizes and summarizes the latest research on the crosstalk between HNC and the nervous system. It aims to clarify various aspects of the neurological system in HNC, including the physiology, progression, and treatment of cancer. Furthermore, the opportunities and challenges of cancer neuroscience in HNC are discussed, which offers fresh perspectives on the neurological aspects of HNC diagnosis and management.",Neuroscience,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12943-025-02299-6,0

"The traditional thesis of the autonomy of psychology from neuroscience is grounded in a metaphysical thesis; the irreducibility thesis. Anti-reductionism is still dominant nowadays, and, as a consequence, autonomists arguably stand on firmer grounds. Still, an anti-autonomist might have the intuition that even if psychology is not reducible to neuroscience, there is a sense, not metaphysically grounded, but epistemologically grounded, in which psychology clearly is not autonomous from neuroscience. The challenge is then to offer a concept of autonomy which allows for the articulation of a new and significant autonomy thesis, and to show that the thesis is false. The thesis that psychologists need not consider neuroscientific explanations when putting forward psychological explanations is such a thesis. I take it that both this characterization of autonomy and an antiautonomist argument in this sense can already be found in a paper co-authored by Gualtiero Piccinini and CarlCraver. Piccinini and Craver’s attack on this thesis is grounded on the claim that psychologists should support their functional analyses by means ofmechanistic explanations for the former to be justified at all. I also take it that, as Lawrence Shapiro has shown, their argument ultimately fails. But this was a very valuable attempt, and, in this paper, I intend to build on it with the aim of offering a new and hopefully effective anti-autonomist argument. I contend that psychologists do need to consider neuroscientific explanations when putting forward psychological explanations, and this stems from the fact that they provide the same type of explanations of the same kind of phenomena as neuroscientist, or so I argue.",Neuroscience,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10670-024-00833-4,0

"Cognitive neuroscience seeks generalizable theories explaining the relationship between behavioral, physiological and mental states. In pursuit of such theories, we propose a theoretical and empirical framework that centers on understanding task demands and the mutual constraints they impose on behavior and neural activity. Task demands emerge from the interaction between an agent’s sensory impressions, goals and behavior, which jointly shape the activity and structure of the nervous system on multiple spatiotemporal scales. Understanding this interaction requires multitask studies that vary more than one experimental component (for example, stimuli and instructions) combined with dense behavioral and neural sampling and explicit testing for generalization across tasks and data modalities. By centering task demands rather than mental processes that tasks are assumed to engage, this framework paves the way for the discovery of new generalizable concepts unconstrained by existing taxonomies, and moves cognitive neuroscience toward an action-oriented, dynamic and integrated view of the brain.",Neuroscience,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1038/s41593-024-01711-6,0
"In recent years, Artificial Intelligence (AI) shows a spectacular ability of insertion inside a variety of disciplines which use it for scientific advancements and which sometimes improve it for their conceptual and methodological needs. According to the transverse science framework originally conceived by Shinn and Joerges, AI can be seen as an instrument which is progressively acquiring a universal character through its diffusion across science. In this paper we address empirically one aspect of this diffusion, namely the penetration of AI into a specific field of research. Taking neuroscience as a case study, we conduct a scientometric analysis of the development of AI in this field. We especially study the temporal egocentric citation network around the articles included in this literature, their represented journals and their authors linked together by a temporal collaboration network. We find that AI is driving the constitution of a particular disciplinary ecosystem in neuroscience which is distinct from other subfields, and which is gathering atypical scientific profiles who are coming from neuroscience or outside it. Moreover we observe that this AI community in neuroscience is socially confined in a specific subspace of the neuroscience collaboration network, which also publishes in a small set of dedicated journals that are mostly active in AI research. According to these results, the diffusion of AI in a discipline such as neuroscience didn’t really challenge its disciplinary orientations but rather induced the constitution of a dedicated socio-cognitive environment inside this field.",Neuroscience,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s41109-024-00618-2,0

"Accurate and precise diagnosis made the medicine the hallmark of evidence-based medicine. While attaining absolute patient satisfaction may seem impossible in the aspect of disease recurrent, personalized their mecidal conditions to their responsive treatment approach may save the day. The last generation approaches in medicine require advanced technologies that will lead to evidence-based medicine. One of the trending fields in this is the use of big data in predictive, preventive, and personalized medicine (3PM). This review dwelled through the practical examples in which big data tools harness neuroscience to add more individualized apporahes to the medical conditions in a bid to confer a more personalized treatment strategies. Moreover, the known breakthroughs of big data in 3PM, big data and 3PM in neuroscience, AI and neuroscience, limitations of big data with 3PM in neuroscience, and the challenges are thoroughly discussed. Finally, the prospects of incorporating big data in 3PM are as well discussed. The review could point out that the implications of big data in 3PM are still in their infancy and will require a holistic approach.

"This essay, derived from a lecture at “The Physics Modeling of Thought” workshop in Berlin in winter 2023, explores the mutually beneficial relationship between theoretical neuroscience and statistical physics through the lens of efficient coding and computation in cortical circuits. It highlights how the study of neural networks has enhanced our understanding of complex, nonequilibrium, and disordered systems, while also demonstrating how neuroscientific challenges have spurred novel developments in physics. The paper traces the evolution of ideas from seminal work on chaos in random neural networks to recent developments in efficient coding and the partial suppression of chaotic fluctuations. It emphasizes how concepts from statistical physics, such as phase transitions and critical phenomena, have been instrumental in elucidating the computational capabilities of neuronal networks in the brain. By examining the interplay between order and disorder in neural computation, the essay illustrates the deep connection between theoretical neuroscience and the statistical physics of nonequilibrium systems.

"Neurotechnology and big data are two rapidly advancing fields that have the potential to transform our understanding of the brain and its functions. Advancements in neurotechnology have enabled researchers to investigate the function of the brain at unprecedented levels of granularity at the functional, molecular, and anatomical levels. Thus, resulting in the collection of not only more data, but also larger datasets. To fully harness the potential of big data and advancements in neurotechnology to improve our understanding of the nervous system, there is a need to train a new generation of neuroscientists capable of not only domain expertise, but also the computational and data science skills required to interrogate and integrate big data. Importantly, neuroinformatics is the subdiscipline of neuroscience devoted to the development of neuroscience data and knowledge bases together with computational models and analytical tools for sharing, integration and analysis of experimental data, and advancement of theories about the nervous system function. While there are only a few formal training programs in neuroinformatics, and since neuroinformatics is rarely incorporated into traditional neuroscience training programs, the neuroinformatics community has attempted to bridge the gap between the traditional neuroscience education programs and the needs of the next generation of neuroscience researchers through community initiatives and workshops.

"The integration of Indigenous perspectives and knowledge with biomedical approaches in neurosciences can significantly broaden the understanding of the human brain and mind. Drawing upon the writings of Elders in Canada, we refer to this integration as Two-Eyed Seeing or Etuaptmumk. We discuss how Two-Eyed Seeing and other dual perspectives can bring both breadth of knowledge and humility to the development of research and clinical practices for brain health. In this forward-looking discussion, we include both traditional academic and non-academic traditions and the work of Indigenous scholars on methodologies, life, health, culture, language and history. To describe challenges and consider solutions, we offer broad strategies for allyship, humility and universalism and situate them in four specific examples pertaining to disability, suicide, migration and the environment. We further advance the power of Two-Eyed Seeing in the context of new considerations for communication and public engagement.

"The societal benefits from sharing and reusing data collected in human neuroscience studies are widely appreciated. However, there are persistent barriers to data sharing as well as privacy concerns related to unauthorized access, misuse, and reidentification of deidentified data. Thus far, few studies have been conducted with neuroscience research participants to understand their data sharing priorities and concerns. We conducted a survey utilizing an experimental design with N = 52 participants in neuroscience studies funded by the U.S. National Institutes of Health representing diverse neurotechnologies and health conditions. Respondents prioritized sharing practices that maximize reuse of data to benefit patients and reduce the possibility of misuse of shared data. Most believed that both advancing research as quickly as possible and protecting their privacy are important. However, when forced to choose between these objectives, two-thirds of respondents believed that advancing research is most important. Reflecting on specific secondary use scenarios, the largest proportion of respondents were concerned about the possibility their shared brain data might be used to discriminate against them. On balance, respondents were less concerned about sharing their health information, including their brain imaging results, than sharing their online, spending, and location histories. The results affirm that data sharing with secondary researchers with the goal of helping patients by advancing research should remain a top priority and provide empirical support for legislation to prevent harms from misuse of sensitive personal data.",Neuroscience,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12152-025-09609-1,0
"This paper presents systematic survey of empirical studies that implement neurocognitive tools to study mathematical processing, learning and problem solving. The survey comprised three stages: identification, screening, and analysis. The search was restricted to English-language papers published in research journals. Of a total of 35,692 records that were identified initially, 598 papers were found eligible for precise data analysis through screening procedure. The bibliometric analysis focused on publication years, journals and authors as well as on collaboration between the researchers. In the content analysis, along with the analysis of neurocognitive tools used in the studies, we screened the papers for the groups of research participants; mathematical topics, concepts and skills examined in the studies. We found that there has been tremendous growth in the past decade in the use of neurocognitive tools to research mathematics learning. The most commonly used tools are the fMRI, EEG, and eye tracking, while use of tools such as GSR and fNIRS remains highly uncommon. There is a strong focus on studying arithmetic, and a recent trend toward examining problem-solving skills, but higher mathematics learning and equation solving remain under-researched. Finally, we found that despite the immense growth in neuroscience research relevant to mathematics education, few studies of this type are published in mathematics education journals.",Neuroscience,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11858-025-01705-z,0
"Computational modelling is a powerful tool for uncovering hidden processes in observed data, yet it faces underappreciated challenges. Among these, determining appropriate sample sizes for computational studies remains a critical but overlooked issue, particularly for model selection analyses. Here we introduce a power analysis framework for Bayesian model selection, a method widely used to choose the best model among alternatives. Our framework reveals that while power increases with sample size, it decreases as more models are considered. Using this framework, we empirically demonstrate that psychology and human neuroscience studies often suffer from low statistical power in model selection. A total of 41 of 52 studies reviewed had less than 80% probability of correctly identifying the true model. The field also heavily relies on fixed effects model selection, which we demonstrate has serious statistical issues, including high false positive rates and pronounced sensitivity to outliers.",Neuroscience,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1038/s41562-025-02348-6,0

Abbott reflects on the philosophical underpinnings and practical challenges of both fields, emphasising the role of mathematical modelling in understanding complex systems. He discusses the status and the unifying role of the Standard Model in physics, compares it to the theoretical framework at the basis of neuroscience, and addresses the sociological and methodological shifts required when applying physical principles to biological phenomena.

"Since spatial transcriptomics can locate and distinguish the gene expression of functional genes in special regions and tissue, it is important for us to investigate the brain development, the development mechanism of brain diseases, and the relationship between brain structure and function in Neuroscience (or Brain science). While previous studies have introduced the crucial spatial transcriptomic techniques and data analysis methods, there are few studies to comprehensively overview the key methods, data resources, and technological applications of spatial transcriptomics in Neuroscience. For these reasons, we first investigate several common spatial transcriptomic data analysis approaches and data resources. Second, we introduce the applications of the spatial transcriptomic data analysis approaches in Neuroscience. Third, we summarize the integrating spatial transcriptomics with other technologies in Neuroscience.

"A fundamental goal of research in neuroscience is to uncover the causal structure of the brain. This focus on causation makes sense, because causal information can provide explanations of brain function and identify reliable targets with which to understand cognitive function and prevent or change neurological conditions and psychiatric disorders. In this research, one of the most frequently used causal concepts is ‘mechanism’ — this is seen in the literature and language of the field, in grant and funding inquiries that specify what research is supported, and in journal guidelines on which contributions are considered for publication. In these contexts, mechanisms are commonly tied to expressions of the main aims of the field and cited as the ‘fundamental’, ‘foundational’ and/or ‘basic’ unit for understanding the brain. Despite its common usage and perceived importance, mechanism is used in different ways that are rarely distinguished. Given that this concept is defined in different ways throughout the field — and that there is often no clarification of which definition is intended — there remains a marked ambiguity about the fundamental goals, orientation and principles of the field. Here we provide an overview of causation and mechanism from the perspectives of neuroscience and philosophy of science, in order to address these challenges.",Neuroscience,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1038/s41583-023-00778-7,0

"Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) enables non-invasive access to the awake, behaving human brain. By tracking whole-brain signals across a diverse range of cognitive and behavioural states or mapping differences associated with specific traits or clinical conditions, fMRI has advanced our understanding of brain function and its links to both normal and atypical behaviour. Despite this headway, progress in human cognitive neuroscience that uses fMRI has been relatively isolated from rapid advances in other subdomains of neuroscience, which themselves are also somewhat siloed from one another. In this Perspective, we argue that fMRI is well-placed to integrate the diverse subfields of systems, cognitive, computational and clinical neuroscience. We first summarize the strengths and weaknesses of fMRI as an imaging tool, then highlight examples of studies that have successfully used fMRI in each subdomain of neuroscience. We then provide a roadmap for the future advances that will be needed to realize this integrative vision. In this way, we hope to demonstrate how fMRI can help usher in a new era of interdisciplinary coherence in neuroscience.",Neuroscience,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1038/s41586-023-06670-9,0

"The philosophical literature on scientific explanation in neuroscience has been dominated by the idea of mechanisms. The mechanist philosophers often claim that neuroscience is in the business of finding mechanisms. This view has been challenged in numerous ways by showing that there are other successful and widespread explanatory strategies in neuroscience. However, the empirical evidence for all these claims was hitherto lacking. Empirical evidence about the pervasiveness and uses of various explanatory strategies in neuroscience is particularly needed because examples and case studies that are used to illustrate philosophical claims so far tend to be hand-picked. The risk of confirmation bias is therefore considerable: when looking for white swans, all one finds is that swans are white. The more systematic quantitative and qualitative bibliometric study of a large body of relevant literature that we present in this paper can put such claims into perspective. Using text mining tools, we identify the typical linguistic patterns used in the alleged mechanistic, dynamical, and topological explanations in the literature, their preponderance and how they change over time. Our findings show abundant use of mechanistic language, but also the presence of a significant neuroscience literature using topological and dynamical explanatory language, which grows over time and increasingly differentiates from each other and from mechanistic explanations.",Neuroscience,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11229-023-04329-6,0
"ObjectiveThe goal of this study was to assess an online collection of brief educational resources (videos, case studies, articles) for teaching a broad range of concepts relating to neuroscience in psychiatry.MethodsA national sample of 52 psychiatrists enrolled in the study. Forty (77%) completed an assessment before and after having access to the educational resources for 4 weeks. Pre- and post-assessments were compared using pairedt-tests. Fifteen participants were randomly selected to participate in a semi-structured interview.ResultsThe mean knowledge score increased on a multiple-choice quiz from 46.9 to 86.4% (p< .01). Based on a 5-point Likert rating, participants reported significant gains in self-confidence in their ability to integrate a neuroscience perspective into their clinical work (p= .03) and to discuss neuroscience with their patients (p= .008). Participants rated the extent that they applied neuroscience concepts (such as neurotransmitters, genetics, epigenetics, synaptic plasticity, and neural circuitry) to their overall case formulation and treatment plan over the past typical work week and how often they discussed these elements with patients. Significant gains were noted across all elements (p≤ .001). Overall satisfaction with the resources were high: participants agreed that the content was useful and relevant (100%) and the teaching resources were engaging (95%). On semi-structured interviews, participants appreciated the mixed teaching approaches and the brief format. Many commented on how the resources impacted their clinical practice.ConclusionsBrief online teaching resources may be an effective approach for enhancing neuroscience education among psychiatrists and may help facilitate the integration of neuroscience into clinical practice.",Neuroscience,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40596-024-01947-1,0

"Magnetoencephalography (MEG) allows the non-invasive measurement of brain activity at millisecond precision combined with localization of the underlying generators. So far, MEG-systems consisted of superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDS), which suffer from several limitations.

Considering potential improvements in the measurement of neuronal signals as well as reduced operating costs, the application of OPM-MEG systems for clinical neuroscience and diagnostic settings is highly promising. Here we provide an overview of the current state-of-the art of OPM-MEG and its unique potential for translational neuroscience.

"Purpose of ReviewTo gather (almost) all (reasonable) theories of phenomenal consciousness, describe them neutrally (largely in the words of their authors), and organize them in a comprehensive, cross-disciplinary taxonomy of categories—""Landscape of Consciousness."" Perhaps the process can encourage novel ways of thinking among medical (psychiatry/neurology) practitioners and neuroscientists.Recent FindingsLandscape organizes more than 350 explanations of phenomenal consciousness across physicalist and non-physicalist traditions. There are 10 primary categories: Materialism. Non-Reductive Physicalism. Quantum & Dimensions. Information. Panpsychisms. Monisms. Dualisms. Idealisms. Anomalous & Altered States. Challenge. Materialism, with the largest number of theories by far, has 12 subcategories: Philosophical. Eliminative/Illusionism. Neurobiological. Electromagnetic Field. Computational & Functionalism. Homeostatic & Affective. Embodied & Enactive. Relational. First-order. Higher-order. Language. Phylogenetic/Evolutionary. Representative theories are here summarized as (non-exhaustive) examples. The Landscape of Consciousness is a work-in-process—permanently.SummaryTwo central theses: (i) understanding phenomenal consciousness at this point should not be restricted to selected ways of thinking or constrained by approved modes of knowing, but should rather seek expansive yet rational diversity, and (ii) issues of sentience, such as AI consciousness, virtual immortality, meaning/purpose, free will, life after death, etc., cannot be understood except in the light of particular theories of consciousness.

"Neurological disorders burden modern healthcare causing cognitive and emotional issues. The Siddha system offers a promising herbal and non-invasive-based therapy. This present review explores the neuromodulatory and neuroprotective effects of the Siddha system integrating herbal and non-invasive interventions with modern neuroscience for a comprehensive treatment strategy against neurological disorders. A detailed literature review was conducted using sources, such as Google search engine, Web of Science, and published databases, focusing on keywords related to ‘Siddha herbal, non-invasive, traditional approach for neurological disorders'. The findings indicate that Siddha-based herbal medicines exhibit significant pharmacological activities, which help slow the progression of neurological diseases. Additionally, Siddha-based non-invasive therapies, such as yoga, meditation, Varma (traditional pressure point therapy), massage, and other external manipulations, have been reported to significantly increase brain activity, improve cognitive function, and enhance the patient’s quality of life. The findings suggest that complementing Siddha-based therapy with modern neuroscience could enhance personalized neurological care in patients. Although Siddha has a rich history in traditional medicine, a significant research gap remains in large-scale clinical trials, treatment standardization, pharmacological validation, and mechanistic understanding. Addressing these gaps could enhance clinical utility in contemporary healthcare, ultimately benefitting brain health and overall well-being.

"In this article we consider the question of homeostasis and memory from the perspectives of neuroscience and psychoanalysis. Our aim is to describe a link between homeostasis/dyshomeostasis, memory/language, and violent acting out. Our study is based on clinical observations concerning two groups of persons: those who were incarcerated for perpetrating non-premeditated murder and those who were victimized by violent trauma in their lives. The clinical findings, combined with the analysis of the relevant literature and research, demonstrate that the dyshomeostatic state, through a positive homeostasis, can drive the person to restore the balance by their usual coping mechanisms and thereby generate negative homeostasis. These acts—all violent, non-premeditated, and forms of desubjectivized acting out—stem from being outside language on account of two pathological extremes of memory, its absence or its excess. Aided by neuroscience and the results of our clinical findings, we support the practice of recalling and strengthening memory traces of trauma in psychotherapy.",Neuroscience,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s11231-025-09498-6,0

"The study of behaviour is dominated by two approaches. On the one hand, ethologists aim to understand how behaviour promotes adaptation to natural contexts. On the other, neuroscientists aim to understand the molecular, cellular, circuit and psychological origins of behaviour. These two complementary approaches must be combined to arrive at a full understanding of behaviour in its natural setting. However, methodological limitations have restricted most neuroscientific research to the study of how discrete sensory stimuli elicit simple behavioural responses under controlled laboratory conditions that are only distantly related to those encountered in real life. Fortunately, the recent advent of neural monitoring and manipulation tools adapted for use in freely behaving animals has enabled neuroscientists to incorporate naturalistic behaviours into their studies and to begin to consider ethological questions. Here, we examine the promises and pitfalls of this trend by describing how investigations of rodent fear, aggression and dominance behaviours are changing to take advantage of an ethological appreciation of behaviour. We lay out current impediments to this approach and propose a framework for the evolution of the field that will allow us to take maximal advantage of an ethological approach to neuroscience and to increase its relevance for understanding human behaviour.",Neuroscience,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1038/s41583-024-00858-2,0
"IntroductionEmotions and feelings are crucial components of our lives. However, their role in medical education scholarship, including in neuroscience education, has been overlooked. Moreover, their impact has been understudied in academia, especially across career stages. We explored emotions and feelings in the context of neuroscience education and across different career stages.MethodsThis work is based on a project exploring the value of learning in postgraduate education, drawing on data from nineteen semi-structured interviews with university alumni and academics. Eight alumni (six females and two males) and eleven academics from a UK-based STEM-intensive institution participated in the study. Alumni refers to former students who have completed the MSc in neuroscience at a STEM-intense institution within the last six years. Lecturers and Senior Lecturers in neuroscience have been labelled asjunior academics, whereas Readers and Professors have been labelledsenior academics.ResultsThe alumni recognised their master experience was intense and challenging, yet acknowledged that enjoyment and stress are two faces of the same coin. Many cited their peers as an inspiration to go beyond the limits but only one student mentioned gratitude, which was never mentioned by the academics. At least one alumnus and one junior academic mentioned trust and confidence, but not the senior academics. Anxiety and confidence (and lack of) dominated the interviews with junior academics, who used intense words when discussing the pleasures of science. Conversely, the senior academics dedicated few words to emotions and feelings, never talked about anxiety, trust or gratitude, and very briefly mentioned the reward linked to sharing their knowledge with the next generations.DiscussionThis work epitomises the importance of exploring emotions and feelings in neuroscience education. Talking more openly about emotions and reducing the pervasive narration of ‘success stories’ might be directions to follow, along with stressing the importance of cultivating self-efficacy, trust and gratitude since the early stages. Meetings between students and supervisors can play a key role in developing self-trust among the students.

"Chronic low back pain (CLBP) significantly impairs quality of life and increases mortality among older adults, making its effective management essential for healthy aging. This quasi-randomized trial compared Pain Neuroscience Education emphasizing physical activity (PNE-PA) with traditional biomechanical treatments (BM) in older women with CLBP over 12 weeks. Community-dwelling women aged 65–90 years with CLBP were assigned to either group based on recruitment timing, using a double-blinded design. PNE-PA aimed to reduce pain-related fear by educating patients about pain neuroscience and encouraging physical activity. Outcomes included physical function, pain intensity, self-reported disability and psychological factors. Analyses used intention-to-treat and bootstrap resampling methods. Between-group differences were assessed using mean differences, 95% confidence intervals (CI), and Cohen’s d.

Specifically, we will explore how computational modeling can both enhance the analysis of high-dimensional imaging datasets and, conversely, how neuroimaging, in conjunction with other data modalities, can inform computational models through the lens of neurobiological plausibility. Collectively, this evidence suggests that neuroimaging remains critical for human neuroscience research, and when enhanced by computational models, imaging can serve an important role in bridging levels of analysis and understanding.

"Neuroscience research has entered a phase of key discoveries in the realm of neurogenomics owing to strong financial and intellectual support for resource building and tool development. The previous challenge of tissue heterogeneity has been met with the application of techniques that can profile individual cells at scale. Moreover, the ability to perturb genes, gene regulatory elements and neuronal activity in a cell-type-specific manner has been integrated with gene expression studies to uncover the functional underpinnings of the genome at a systems level. Although these insights have necessarily been grounded in model systems, we now have the opportunity to apply these approaches in humans and in human tissue, thanks to advances in human genetics, brain imaging and tissue collection. We acknowledge that there will probably always be limits to the extent to which we can apply the genomic tools developed in model systems to human neuroscience; however, as we describe in this Perspective, the neuroscience field is now primed with an optimal foundation for tackling this ambitious challenge. The application of systems-level network analyses to these datasets will facilitate a deeper appreciation of human neurogenomics that cannot otherwise be achieved from directly observable phenomena.",Neuroscience,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1038/s41586-023-06686-1,0
"BackgroundThe field of neurosurgical education has seen significant advancements in recent years. However, the distribution of advanced neurosurgical education remains uneven, particularly in developing countries like Iraq. This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of the neurosurgical lab at Neuroscience Hospital in Baghdad, focusing on its impact on surgical precision, skill and acquisition among neurosurgery residents.MethodA cross-sectional survey targeted neurosurgeons, neurosurgical residents, and medical students actively utilizing the lab. The survey assessed the frequency of lab use, the impact of lab resources on clinical practice, and skill development. Data was analyzed using descriptive statistics and chi-square tests to explore associations between variables such as lab usage frequency, satisfaction, and professional development.ResultsForty participants responded to the questionnaire. The results revealed that 60% of the participants expressed high satisfaction. The microscope and training models were considered highly impactful, with 80% of participants rating these resources as 4 or 5 on a 5-point scale. The chi-square tests revealed a statistically significant relationship between lab use frequency and satisfaction (χ² = 11.4,p= 0.010).ConclusionThe neurosurgical lab at Neuroscience Hospital has proven to be an essential resource for enhancing surgical skills and promoting innovation. The findings highlight the need for continued integration of advanced technologies like 3D printing to improve neurosurgical training and outcomes in resource-limited settings.",Neuroscience,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12909-025-07535-7,0
"Concurrent transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (TMS-fMRI) provides a step-change in the toolkit of neuroscience research. TMS enables the noninvasive perturbation of ongoing human brain activity, and when coupled to fMRI for the simultaneous read-out of its effects across the brain, concurrent TMS-fMRI enables studies aimed at determining the causal inference of human brain–behavior relationships, with implications for both fundamental research and clinical application. Many of the technical barriers to TMS-fMRI implementation, such as hardware design and setups, have now been overcome, and the research community in the field is rapidly growing. Here, we present the guidelines set by an international consensus, from researchers at all levels and across the fields of cognitive and applied human neuroscience, for the experimental design and practical considerations of concurrent TMS-fMRI via 12 detailed use cases. These guidelines may facilitate the uptake of this approach and simplify the experimental design and planning stages.",Neuroscience,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1038/s41596-025-01182-4,0
"Despite their alignment with sustainable development principles, wind farms often provoke controversy and misinformation, particularly regarding the noise they produce and their potential impact on human functioning. Concerns have been raised about the possible effects of this noise on irritation levels, psychological well-being, and cognitive functioning. Yet, there is still a lack of controlled, comprehensive studies that could substantiate these concerns. Here, a cognitive neuroscience approach is proposed to experimentally and multifactorial explore wind turbine noise’s impact on various mental functions. We used recordings from an actual wind turbine to investigate its effects on the dynamics of brain waves crucial for complex cognitive tasks, as well as on sustained attention and inductive reasoning in healthy adult volunteers. We also tested the subjective evaluation of the stress induced by wind turbine noise and the annoyance it causes. Control conditions included silence and road traffic noise (participants were blind to the nature of acoustic variables). The findings of this pilot study reveal that short-term exposure to wind turbine noise with a sound pressure level corresponding to the real-world situation (i.e., 65 dB SPL) does not adversely affect any of the examined cognitive functions and is not perceived as more stressful or bothersome than road traffic noise. Furthermore, we utilized various psychological scales and found that even tendencies towards rumination or reduced capacity for reflection and ambiguity tolerance did not lead to maladaptive perceptions of wind turbine noise and, therefore, to a state that might indirectly influence mental functioning. Although these results cannot be generalized, they support the concept that the interlinkage between exposure to wind turbine noise and human cognitive functioning is not a cause-and-effect relationship. We discuss the mediating role of socially constructed beliefs about wind farms in this interrelation. We also indicate how important the use of a cognitive neuroscience approach in future research may be for an objective assessment of the impact of wind farms on human cognition.",Neuroscience,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s41599-025-04645-x,0
"To optimize the efficacy of analgesia for patients receiving laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair, peri-operative pain neuroscience education (PNE) as a pain-specific cognitive therapy was incorporated into multi-modal analgesia. A randomized controlled trial was conducted to compare conventional analgesia (group CA) and the addition of pain neuroscience education into it (group PNE) in patients receiving laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair. Characteristics of peri-operative pain was evaluated with Douleur Neuropathique 4 questionnaire (DN-4), central sensitization inventory (CSI), pain catastrophizing scale (PCS) post-operatively and pressure pain threshold. Post-operative quality of recovery was measured with EuroQol five dimensions questionnaire (EQ-5D-5L). The incidence of chronic post-operative pain was also recorded. A total of 184 patients consented to participate in this study and finished follow-up. Compared with those receiving conventional analgesia (group CA,N= 91), patients in group PNE (N= 93) reported reduced incidence of moderate-to-severe pain and less dosages of opioid during hospitalization (p< 0.05). Catastrophing, sensitization related to pain were reduced in group PNE (p< 0.05). Quality of recovery was improved till 1 month after surgery (p< 0.05). The addition of pain neuroscience education improved analgesic effect and quality of recovery for patients undergoing laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair. It also helped reduce sensitization and catastrophic of acute surgical pain. This psychologically-oriented analgesic approach merits future research and application for these patients.",Neuroscience,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1038/s41598-025-86534-6,0

"The Metaverse and its possibilities as a workplace are proposed as a very promising future reality although with different enigmas to solve. This research work was carried out in a cross-sectional study with a qualitative approach and a deductive methodology, analysing more than 100 studies found in various major databases. The work environment and the emotions generated within it influence the happiness, health and performance of employees. Emotions and well-being affect decision-making, engagement, health and performance, although this has not yet been explored in the Metaverse. One of the important findings of this study is this lack of research. Moreover, a further finding has been identified, namely the potential for the application of neuroscience in order to research this knowledge gap and to apply this knowledge in companies with a view to enhancing the performance of workers. The lack of research into health risks, motivation and emotional management in the Metaverse can result in musculoskeletal disorders due to poor ergonomics problems such as muscle strain due to the use of inappropriate equipment or the performance of tasks according to incorrect procedures; eye diseases or disorders due to the use of inappropriate designs, colours, working hours and eye trackers; lack of productivity due to excessive fatigue, incorrect procedures and lack of work organisation. Stress disorders and demotivation lead to depression and anxiety along with a lack of understanding and feeling between colleagues and with the boss. In general, this could lead to a company with physically and mentally ill workers in addition to being unproductive. While studies exploring these effects in the Metaverse are lacking, applied neuromanagement should not be overlooked as a means of enhancing labour relations, organisation, workplaces and possibly providing competitive advantages. Could neuroscience contribute to a deeper understanding of the conditions experienced by workers in the Metaverse? Applied neuromanagement enables the continuous monitoring of an employee’s emotional state using brain activity and different psychophysiological variables; stress could be monitored using psychophysiological variables, attention could be evaluated using eye tracking and muscular tension could be measured and enables other applications. Emotional states have influence on the motivation and the development of diseases such as depression, anxiety and stress. Emotional states influence motivation and the development of diseases such as depression, anxiety and stress. By regulating emotional states, muscular tension, attention and stress, it is possible to enhance the performance of workers in the Metaverse and prevent the onset of diseases. These factors could assist with the design of the workplace, the organisation of tasks, the monitoring of emotional states and other workplace-related issues, thereby conferring a competitive advantage on the company. Nevertheless, the initial investment in technology required by companies will vary depending on the techniques they intend to employ. In addition, the availability of trained personnel capable of implementing these techniques is a crucial factor. In essence, organisations that aspire to integrate neuromanagement into their managerial practices must first identify the techniques they intend to adopt, procure the requisite equipment (which represents a relatively modest investment for an enterprise) and then appoint or train an individual to oversee the implementation of these techniques. In conclusion, it is possible to state that a significant amount of research in this field and its application in companies are essential. Failure to comply with this necessity could result in serious consequences for the health and motivation of workers in the Metaverse. Conversely, the integration of these practices can yield substantial benefits, encompassing enhanced health and productivity, as well as a competitive advantage.",Neuroscience,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s43093-025-00457-2,0
"Cancer neuroscience has evolved as a novel discipline that elucidates the intricate relationships between the neurological system and neoplasms. Research indicates that the ablation of particular nerve types, including parasympathetic, sympathetic, or sensory nerves, can suppress tumour growth in a tissue-specific manner. Moreover, numerous tumours exhibit greater innervation density than their normal tissue equivalents, prompting essential enquiries on the processes of tumour innervation and its molecular contribution to disease progression. These findings underscore the significant clinical ramifications of tumour axon production and establish a theoretical foundation for the development of anticancer treatments aimed at neural mechanisms. Current studies have investigated the potential effectiveness of repurposing neuroactive pharmaceuticals as anticancer medicines, and emerging therapies for chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy.

"Educational neuroscience aims to merge neuroscience and education for better teaching and learning outcomes. Translating scientific findings into educator-friendly terms is crucial to empower teachers in applying these insights to teaching methods. Despite advancements in neuroeducation, a significant gap persists, and there is a lack of specific neuro-educational pedagogical knowledge, notably in early childhood math education. This exploratory review article outlines recent neuroscientific insights into numerical understanding in the human brain. It presents seven neuro-pedagogical principles essential for developing mathematical abilities in early childhood: (1) Mathematical abilities are distributed across various brain regions. (2) Innate mathematical abilities exist in young children. (3) Brain networks for perceiving quantities are vital for mathematical thinking and evolve with age and experience. (4) Distinguishing between small and large quantities (subitizing) can mediate between the innate ability to understand quantities and the later understanding of numbers and their meaning. (5) A mental number line maps numbers spatially. (6) Neurocognitive mechanisms perceive and manipulate numerical information through a triple code: quantity, numerals, and number words. (7) Finger gnosis, the ability to identify fingers without visual involvement, correlates with mathematical abilities. Each principle is discussed in terms of ongoing research, limitations of the current findings, and practical implications and examples suitable for early childhood educators.",Neuroscience,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10643-024-01656-2,0
"Neural structural representations are cerebral map- or model-like structures that structurally resemble what they represent. These representations are absolutely central to the “cognitive neuroscience revolution”, as they are the only type of representation compatible with the revolutionaries’ mechanistic commitments. Crucially, however, these very same commitments entail that structural representations can be observed in the swirl of neuronal activity. Here, I argue that no structural representations have been observed being present in our neuronal activity, no matter the spatiotemporal scale of observation. My argument begins by introducing the “cognitive neuroscience revolution” (Sect.1) and sketching a prominent, widely adopted account of structural representations (Sect.2). Then, I will consult various reports that describe our neuronal activity at various spatiotemporal scales, arguing that none of them reports the presence of structural representations (Sect.3). After having deflected certain intuitive objections to my analysis (Sect.4), I will conclude that, in the absence of neural structural representations, representationalism and mechanism can’t go together, and so the “cognitive neuroscience revolution” is forced to abandon one of its commitments (Sect.5).",Neuroscience,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11229-023-04418-6,0

"In human neuroscience, machine learning can help reveal lower-dimensional neural representations relevant to subjects’ behavior. However, state-of-the-art models typically require large datasets to train, and so are prone to overfitting on human neuroimaging data that often possess few samples but many input dimensions. Here, we capitalized on the fact that the features we seek in human neuroscience are precisely those relevant to subjects’ behavior rather than noise or other irrelevant factors. We thus developed a Task-Relevant Autoencoder via Classifier Enhancement (TRACE) designed to identify behaviorally-relevant target neural patterns. We benchmarked TRACE against a standard autoencoder and other models for two severely truncated machine learning datasets (to match the data typically available in functional magnetic resonance imaging [fMRI] data for an individual subject), then evaluated all models on fMRI data from 59 subjects who observed animals and objects. TRACE outperformed alternative models nearly unilaterally, showing up to 12% increased classification accuracy and up to 56% improvement in discovering “cleaner”, task-relevant representations. These results showcase TRACE’s potential for a wide variety of data related to human behavior.",Neuroscience,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1038/s41598-024-83867-6,0
"Purpose of ReviewDue to various reasons including psychobiological states and psychopathological conditions, individuals may be more inclined toward choices or actions that are known as impulsive. This preference arises from either or both personality characteristics (trait), which are more stable, or impulsive tendencies that emerge in response to environmental factors and/or internal factors (e.g., mood) and fluctuate over time (state). Although both types of impulsivity are closely tied to addiction, particularly in terms of treatment outcomes (e.g., poor adherence, increased relapse risk), state impulsivity is susceptible to influences of context and the saliency of cues. One specific form of state impulsivity, known as context-dependent impulsivity, is evoked by contextual drug-related cues and could be conceptualized, monitored, and assessed using the cue-reactivity paradigm. In this paper, we aim to tease apart the neurocognitive mechanisms which are influenced or heightened by context-dependent impulsivity and explain how these mechanisms may interfere with addiction treatment.Recent FindingsBy integrating evidence from classic neuropsychological measures and the drug-cue reactivity paradigm in the field of addiction, we propose a neuroscience-informed conceptual framework explaining how relapse may occur due to the disruption of neurocognitive mechanisms in response to contextual cues. We introduce the term 'context-dependent impulsivity' in accordance with the cue-reactivity paradigm as a marker of addiction recovery and as a mechanistic target for cue-based interventions such as cognitive bias modification and mindfulness-based relapse prevention.SummaryContext-dependent impulsivity is a multi-faceted construct, which could be characterized by specific cognitive phenotypes. Parsing these different phenotypes into their constituent neurocognitive mechanisms and examining their interactions with relapse vulnerability could inform clinicians about optimized cognitive interventions and neuropsychological assessments tailored to individuals with specific impulsivity phenotypes within the trait or state levels.",Neuroscience,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40429-025-00615-0,0

"Anxiety disorders affect millions of people worldwide and present a challenge in neuroscience research because of their substantial heterogeneity in clinical presentation. While a great deal of progress has been made in understanding the neurobiology of fear and anxiety, these insights have not led to effective treatments. Understanding the relationship between phenotypic heterogeneity and the underlying biology is a critical first step in solving this problem. We show translation, reverse translation, and computational modeling can contribute to a refined, cross-species understanding of fear and anxiety as well as anxiety disorders. More specifically, we outline how animal models can be leveraged to develop testable hypotheses in humans by using targeted, cross-species approaches and ethologically informed behavioral paradigms. We discuss reverse translational approaches that can guide and prioritize animal research in nontraditional research species. Finally, we advocate for the use of computational models to harmonize cross-species and cross-methodology research into anxiety. Together, this translational neuroscience approach will help to bridge the widening gap between how we currently conceptualize and diagnose anxiety disorders, as well as aid in the discovery of better treatments for these conditions.",Neuroscience,https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13415-024-01162-3,0
"The brain is one of the most complex living tissue types and is composed of an exceptional diversity of cell types displaying unique functional connectivity. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) can be used to efficiently map the molecular identities of the various cell types in the brain by providing the transcriptomic profiles of individual cells isolated from the tissue. However, the lack of spatial context in scRNA-seq prevents a comprehensive understanding of how different configurations of cell types give rise to specific functions in individual brain regions and how each distinct cell is connected to form a functional unit. To understand how the various cell types contribute to specific brain functions, it is crucial to correlate the identities of individual cells obtained through scRNA-seq with their spatial information in intact tissue. Spatial transcriptomics (ST) can resolve the complex spatial organization of cell types in the brain and their connectivity. Various ST tools developed during the past decade based on imaging and sequencing technology have permitted the creation of functional atlases of the brain and have pulled the properties of neural circuits into ever-sharper focus. In this review, we present a summary of several ST tools and their applications in neuroscience and discuss the unprecedented insights these tools have made possible.",Neuroscience,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1038/s12276-023-01093-y,0
"The nervous system regulates tissue stem and precursor populations throughout life. Parallel to roles in development, the nervous system is emerging as a critical regulator of cancer, from oncogenesis to malignant growth and metastatic spread. Various preclinical models in a range of malignancies have demonstrated that nervous system activity can control cancer initiation and powerfully influence cancer progression and metastasis. Just as the nervous system can regulate cancer progression, cancer also remodels and hijacks nervous system structure and function. Interactions between the nervous system and cancer occur both in the local tumour microenvironment and systemically. Neurons and glial cells communicate directly with malignant cells in the tumour microenvironment through paracrine factors and, in some cases, through neuron-to-cancer cell synapses. Additionally, indirect interactions occur at a distance through circulating signals and through influences on immune cell trafficking and function. Such cross-talk among the nervous system, immune system and cancer—both systemically and in the local tumour microenvironment—regulates pro-tumour inflammation and anti-cancer immunity. Elucidating the neuroscience of cancer, which calls for interdisciplinary collaboration among the fields of neuroscience, developmental biology, immunology and cancer biology, may advance effective therapies for many of the most difficult to treat malignancies.",Neuroscience,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1038/s41586-023-05968-y,0

"ObjectivesEarly theories of autism aligned closely with contemporaneous theories of developmental cognitive neuroscience at the time. Since then, autism has developed into its own research field, and links with developmental cognitive neuroscience are fewer. This divergence means our understanding of autism may be built on older neuroscientific theories, and the implications of newer theories in developmental cognitive neuroscience for autism and neurodiversity may not be considered.MethodsWithout assuming any neuroscientific background of the reader, we describe older theories of developmental cognitive neuroscience, namely nativism and empiricism, and consider their relationship to autism. We then contrast these with the more recent theories of neuroconstructivism and interactive specialisation.ResultsWe argue that applying neuroconstructivism and interactive specialisation to autism and neurodiversity suggests we can view neurodivergent brains as optimised differently, rather than disordered. Deficits are not necessarily required, strengths may be expected, and greater scope for variation in neurotypes arises through the role of environment on development.ConclusionsWe conclude that neuroconstructivism and interactive specialisation are compatible or even supportive of neurodiversity and create a new neuroscientific dimension with which to explore neurodiversity. However, the potential for the environment to influence autistic development challenges some aspects of neurodiversity and highlights the need for collaborative research and clinical practice with autistic people.",Neuroscience,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s41252-025-00470-0,0

"Soliton theory research has a substantial impact on the application of nonlinear sciences in different fields. This has led to a significant increase in the focus of researchers on the study of solitary waves in recent years. This study explores the diverse dynamic behaviors exhibited by soliton solutions within the framework of the soliton neuron model. In neuroscience, this model is regarded as an important tool for comprehending the initiation and propagation of action potentials along axons through the application of a thermodynamic theory of nerve pulse transmission. The model proposed herein suggests that signals that propagate through the cell membrane can be represented as solitons, or solitary sound pulses. In order to analyze these soliton solutions, the nonlinear differential equation is transformed into the corresponding ordinary differential equation using a wave transformation. The wave profiles of the soliton neuron model are derived by using the Kumar-Malik method, multivariate generalized exponential rational integral function method, and Riccati modified extended simple equation method. These methods are implemented to extract a diverse array of soliton solutions, such as mixed, dark, bright-dark, singular, bright, complex, and combined solitons. This examination is focused on specific nonlinear phenomena of the proposed model. Numerous graphs are incorporated to clarify the behavior of solutions across a diverse range of parameter values. By validating the effectiveness of current methodologies and elucidating the nonlinear dynamic characteristics of a system, this research makes a substantial contribution to the domains of nonlinear science and higher-dimensional nonlinear wave fields.

UK university neuroscience societies act as a local environment for students to develop their career interests and provide portfolio building opportunities through hosting events such as annual conferences. Recently there has been a transition to more of these events being held online yet the impact of this, if any, remains unclear. This prospective study aimed to identify the impact of student-led neuroscience conferences on delegates and examine attitudes towards an online delivery approach.MethodsMulti-centre prospective survey study using pre-conference, post-conference, and 6-month post-conference online questionnaires distributed at 6 virtual student-led neuroscience conferences in 2021. The questionnaires had five-domains: demographics, career aspirations, academic skillsets, an educational manipulation check (EMC) and mode of delivery preference.ResultsNine hundred twenty-four surveys were completed across 559 conference attendances. 79.9% of delegates were medical students. Interest in a neuroscience career (p< 0.001), preparedness to undertake research (p< 0.001) and presentation (p< 0.001), as well as EMC scores (p< 0.001) increased immediately post conference.

"Stemness, giving cancer cells massive plasticity enabling them to survive in dynamic (e.g. hypoxic) environments and become resistant to treatment, especially chemotherapy, is an important property of aggressive tumours. Here, we review some essentials of cancer stemness focusing on triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), the most aggressive form of all breast cancers. TNBC cells express a range of genes and mechanisms associated with stemness, including the fundamental four “Yamanaka factors”. Most of the evidence concerns the transcription factor / oncogenec-Mycand an interesting case is the expression of the neonatal splice variant of voltage-gated sodium channel subtype Nav1.5. On the whole, measures that reduce the stemness make cancer cells less aggressive, reducing their invasive/metastatic potential and increasing/restoring their chemosensitivity. Such measures include gene silencing techniques, epigenetic therapies as well as novel approaches like optogenetics aiming to modulate the plasma membrane voltage. Indeed, simply hyperpolarizing their membrane potential can make stem cells differentiate. Finally, we give an overview of the clinical aspects and exploitation of cancer/TNBC stemness, including diagnostics and therapeutics. In particular, personalised mRNA-based therapies and mechanistically meaningful combinations are promising and the emerging discipline of ‘cancer neuroscience’ is providing novel insights to both fundamental issues and clinical applications.Graphical Abstract",Neuroscience,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12015-024-10809-0,0

This review explores resistive switching mechanisms such as interface-regulated filament growth, molecular-electronic dynamics, nanowire-confined filament growth, and vacancy-assisted ion migration, while proposing methodologies to enhance state retention and conductance adjustment. The survey examines the challenges faced in implementing low-power neuromorphic computing, e.g., reducing device size and improving switching time. The review analyses the potential of these materials in adjustable, flexible, and low-power consumption applications, viz. biohybrid spiking circuits interacting with biological systems, systems that respond to specific events, robotics, intelligent agents, neuromorphic computing, neuromorphic bioelectronics, neuroscience, and other applications, and prospects of this technology.",Neuroscience,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40820-025-01756-7,0

"This essay explores the intersection between Kantian aesthetics, neuroscience, and evolutionary theories of beauty, examining how the judgment of taste operates as both a subjective and universal experience. Kant’s theory of beauty, as outlined in theCritique of Judgment, proposes that aesthetic judgment is based on a free play between the faculties of Imagination and Understanding, independent of conceptual determination. The experience of beauty does not derive from an inherent property of the object but rather from a harmonious cognitive state induced by perception. This perspective is contrasted with contemporary approaches that seek to naturalize aesthetics through neuroscience and evolutionary theory. Aesthetic judgment cannot be fully explained by neural mechanisms or evolutionary advantages alone. Instead, beauty emerges from a co-evolution of biology, cognition, and cultural structures, paralleling the emergence of language. The capacity for aesthetic judgment reflects the unique interplay between perception, symbolic thought, and cultural discourse, reinforcing Kant’s insight that beauty is both a subjective feeling and a universal claim. Ultimately, aesthetic experience is best understood as an emergent phenomenon, wherein biological predispositions, cognitive faculties, and linguistic expression converge to form a shared yet deeply personal dimension of human existence.",Neuroscience,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10699-025-09981-4,0
"Deep learning (DL) is a statistical technique for pattern classification through which AI researchers train artificial neural networks containing multiple layers that process massive amounts of data. I present a three-level account of explanation that can be reasonably expected from DL models in cognitive neuroscience and that illustrates the explanatory dynamics within a future-biased research program (Feest Philosophy of Science 84:1165–1176,2017; Doerig et al. Nature Reviews: Neuroscience 24:431–450,2023). By relying on the mechanistic framework (Craver Explaining the brain: Mechanisms and the mosaic unity of neuroscience. Clarendon,2007; Stinson Eppuor si muove: Doing history and philosophy of Science with Peter Machamer. Springer,2017, The Routledge Handbook of the computational mind. Routledge,2018), I develop an account that corresponds to the stages of mechanism discovery, i.e., our shifting epistemic position and epistemic goals, and propose a representative model for each level. Generic, theoretical DL models atLevel 1address the general features of a cognitive phenomenon through exploration and provide us with how-possibly explanations. On the other hand, DL models atLevel 2either identify the interaction between the features or represent the epistemic stage when the researcher is still unsure if the modeled features are crucial or arbitrary. These models should provide us with how-plausibly explanations. Finally, specific DL models of specific brain areas, i.e., ersatz models filled with relevant cognitive and neuroscientific details, are atLevel 3. At this level, a researcher can advance how-actually explanations of cognitive phenomena. The main strength of this account is that it elucidates bothglobal explanatory dynamicsandlocal explanatory dynamics(cf. Dresow Synthese 199:10441–10474,2021). The former occurs when the transition between levels happens in accordance with the process of obtaining more details about a particular cognitive phenomenon through multiple DL models. The latter, meanwhile, involves cases in which the transition between levels takes place within a single DL model by elucidating internal mechanisms (e.g., using Explainable AI techniques for rendering models more transparent).",Neuroscience,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11229-024-04514-1,0
"Autism is a neurodevelopmental condition, behaviourally identified, which is generally characterised by social communication differences, and restrictive and repetitive patterns of behaviour and interests. It has long been claimed that it is more common in males. This observed preponderance of males in autistic populations has served as a focussing framework in all spheres of autism-related issues, from recognition and diagnosis through to theoretical models and research agendas. One related issue is the near total absence of females in key research areas. For example, this paper reports a review of over 120 brain-imaging studies of social brain processes in autism that reveals that nearly 70% only included male participants or minimal numbers (just one or two) of females. Authors of such studies very rarely report that their cohorts are virtually female-free and discuss their findings as though applicable to all autistic individuals. The absence of females can be linked to exclusionary consequences of autism diagnostic procedures, which have mainly been developed on male-only cohorts. There is clear evidence that disproportionately large numbers of females do not meet diagnostic criteria and are then excluded from ongoing autism research. Another issue is a long-standing assumption that the female autism phenotype is broadly equivalent to that of the male autism phenotype. Thus, models derived from male-based studies could be applicable to females. However, it is now emerging that certain patterns of social behaviour may be very different in females. This includes a specific type of social behaviour called camouflaging or masking, linked to attempts to disguise autistic characteristics. With respect to research in the field of sex/gender cognitive neuroscience, there is emerging evidence of female differences in patterns of connectivity and/or activation in the social brain that are at odds with those reported in previous, male-only studies. Decades of research have excluded or overlooked females on the autistic spectrum, resulting in the construction of inaccurate and misleading cognitive neuroscience models, and missed opportunities to explore the brain bases of this highly complex condition. A note of warning needs to be sounded about inferences drawn from past research, but if future research addresses this problem of male bias, then a deeper understanding of autism as a whole, as well as in previously overlooked females, will start to emerge.",Neuroscience,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s13293-024-00621-3,0
"Recent work in philosophy of science has shown how the challenges posed by extremely complex systems require that scientists employ a range of modelling strategies, leading to partial perspectives that make apparently conflicting claims about the target (Mitchell 2009b, Longino 2013). The brain is of course extremely complex, and the same arguments apply here. In this paper I present a variety of perspectivism calledhaptic realism. This account foregrounds the process by which the instrumental goals of neuroscience shape the way that objects of investigation are probed experimentally and conceptualised through modelling. Because such models do not aim to represent their targets exactly as they are, but in ways that are most useful for the investigators, the models should not be interpreted as literal descriptions of neural systems. Scientific realism traditionally involves a semantic commitment to interpreting theories and models as literal descriptions of human-independent nature. Haptic realism makes a significant departure from this tradition. Haptic realism also calls us to reassess the ontological commitments and knowledge claims of neuroscientific models and theories.",Neuroscience,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11229-023-04295-z,0
"ObjectiveThe neuroscience of human empathy for pleasure and positive affect is an emergent, scarcely addressed topic. The main aim of this scoping review is to map the impact of this new research domain on the field of social and affective neuroscience.IntroductionMost of the literature on empathy and affect sharing has hitherto focused on negative emotions, with a special focus on pain. However, understanding, sharing, and reacting to others’ pleasures is an evolutionarily and socially important function. Our scoping review addresses this gap in the literature and tries to unify the available information under the empathy for pleasure umbrella.Inclusion criteriaThis scoping review is intended to cover studies on empathy for positive emotions, pleasant sensory outcomes, and other rewards in healthy individuals and neurological/neuropsychiatric/neurodevelopmental disorders populations.MethodsWe will perform a systematic search in the Medline (PubMed), Scopus, and Web of Science (WoS) databases. Two authors will independently screen all titles, abstracts, and then full-text articles that meet the inclusion criteria. The year range of interest will be 2000–2022, and only journal articles published in English will be assessed. Data will be extracted and presented in tables and/or graphical representations to synthesize and describe the results. The extracted data will be reported in a comprehensive summary.ResultsThe final manuscript is intended for submission to an indexed journal in late 2023/beginning 2024.ConclusionsTo our knowledge, the present scoping review will be the first to address the variety and heterogeneity of available evidence on human empathy for pleasure. We ultimately aim at perusing the growing literature on this far-reaching field of study and informing future research.Systematic review registrationThe neuroscience of human empathy for pleasure: Protocol for a scoping review.https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/W7H6J.

"In this paper, I examined whether evidence from the neuroscience of morality supports the standard models ofphronesis, i.e., Jubilee and Aretai Centre Models. The standard models explainphronesisas a multifaceted construct based on interaction and coordination among functional components. I reviewed recent neuroscience studies focusing on brain networks associated with morality and their connectivity to examine the validity of the models. Simultaneously, I discussed whether the evidence helps the models address challenges, particularly those from thephronesiseliminativism. Neuroscientific evidence supported the importance of brain networks, i.e., the default mode, salience, and central executive functioning networks, in moral functioning in general. The findings favorably supported the multifaceted and integrative nature ofphronesisproposed by the standard models. Finally, I considered how the two models could explain the mechanisms ofphronesismore integratively based on neuroscientific findings. At the end of this paper, with the evidence, I proposed several practical ideas to promote the cultivation ofphronesis, e.g., the consideration of coordination among components for moral functioning and the use of moral exemplars.",Neuroscience,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11245-023-10001-y,0
"Tardigrades are microscopic organisms known for their remarkable
                resilience to extreme environmental conditions, including radiation and desiccation.
                Two key proteins, Dsup (Damage suppressor protein) and CAHS D (Cytoplasmic Abundant
                Heat Soluble protein D), play crucial roles in this resilience. Dsup protects DNA
                from radiation-induced damage, while CAHS D stabilizes cellular structures during
                desiccation by interacting with, but not retaining, water. These unique mechanisms
                have significant potential applications in neurosurgery and neuroscience. Dsup could

"Scientists studying in the fields of AI and neuroscience can learn much from each other, but unfortunately, since about the 1950s, it has been mostly one-sided: neuroscientists have learned from AI, but less so the other way. I argue this is holding back both brain understanding and progress in AI. Current AI (“neural network”/deep learning algorithms) and the brain are very different from each other. The brain does not seem to use trial-and-error–type learning algorithms such as backpropagation to modify weights and more importantly does not require the cumbersome rehearsal needed for trial-and-error implementation. The brain can learn information in a modular and true “one-shot” fashion as the information is encountered while the AI cannot. Instead of backpropagation and rehearsal, there is evidence that the brain regulates its inputs during recognition using regulatory feedback: form the outputs back to inputs—the same inputs that activate the outputs. This is observed through evidence from the fields of neuroscience and cognitive psychology but is not present in current algorithms. Thus, the brain provides an abundance of evidence about its underlying algorithms and while computer science tools and analysis are essential, algorithms guided by computer science should not be standardized into neuroscience theories.",Neuroscience,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12559-023-10194-9,0
"The study of the multifaceted interactions between neuroscience and cancer is an emerging field with significant implications for understanding tumor biology and the innovation in therapeutic approaches. Increasing evidence suggests that neurological functions are connected with tumorigenesis. In particular, the peripheral and central nervous systems, synapse, neurotransmitters, and neurotrophins affect tumor progression and metastasis through various regulatory approaches and the tumor immune microenvironment. In this review, we summarized the neurological functions that affect tumorigenesis and metastasis, which are controlled by the central and peripheral nervous systems. We also explored the roles of neurotransmitters and neurotrophins in cancer progression. Moreover, we examined the interplay between the nervous system and the tumor immune microenvironment. We have also identified drugs that target the nervous system for cancer treatment.

"In neuroscience, functional connectivity is a concept that can be mathematically formulated as a graph of interactions between oscillatory brain rhythms and individual neuronal activity. Typically, each graph corresponds to a cognitive state and provides insight into higher cognitive processes, such as learning. However, a model or method to assess directed interactions within and across brain oscillations and individual neuronal activity is lacking. In this article, we propose a new model called HM-MVAR (Heterogeneous Multiscale Multivariate Autoregressive) that represents linear combinations of neural interaction patterns. These patterns include phase-locking, where the amplitude of one signal is modulated by the phase of another, and power-triggered phenomena, where the amplitude of one signal is modulated by the amplitude of another. Due to the multiscale structure, we use a block version of stationarity to exhibit conditions under which the process obeying the HM-MVAR model exists and is stationary. We also propose a data-driven weighted LASSO estimator based on martingale exponential deviation inequalities, which may have intrinsic interest in probability theory. We prove that our estimator satisfies an oracle inequality and present its strong performance in realistic simulations. Finally, applying our model and method on a publicly available multiscale electrophysiological data set, we recover interactions described in the literature but also uncover new phenomena of potential interest.",Neuroscience,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00285-025-02224-x,0

"The study of competition from
a social comparison perspective offers valuable insights into the neuroscience of social judgment and decision making under uncertainty. When engaging in social comparison, individuals seek and assess information about similarities or differences between others and themselves, in large part to improve their self-evaluation. By providing information about one’s relative position, abilities, outcomes, and more, social comparisons can inform competitive judgments and decisions. People reasonably turn to social comparisons to reduce uncertainty before, during, and after competition. However, the extent to which they do so and the behavioral consequences of social comparisons often fail to match the potential benefits of improved self-evaluation. An examination of the developing neuroscience of social comparison and competition in light of the behavioral evidence reveals numerous questions that merit further investigation.",Neuroscience,https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13415-023-01107-2,0

"Unlocking the neural regulation of complex behavior is a foundational goal of brain science. Touchscreen-based assessments of behavior have been used extensively in the pursuit of this goal, with traditional pharmacological and neurochemical approaches being employed to provide key insights into underlying neural systems.

Through partnerships and patient enrolment, the study aimed to inform patient care and treatment selection to improve outcomes.MethodsHere, we evaluate the methodologies and results yielded from patient and public involvement (PPI) efforts within COVID-CNS, an important element of the research cycle which introduces patient perspectives and enhances research relevance.ResultsPPI involvement in the study heralded many accomplishments and contributed to the success of the study, in particular improving accessibility in study design and tools reducing patient burden; inclusivity and accessibility of the study in terms of recruitment; and in the plethora of assets to maximise dissemination of the study findings. Several challenges were identified, including barriers to diversify the PPI panel, difficulties faced by panel members to engage in PPI activities due to personal circumstances, as well as significant obstacles caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Specific outcomes from this evaluation have included: identifying diversity gaps in the PPI panel, a deeper understanding of the impact of the PPI panel, including creating and adapting patient material, dissemination documents and raising awareness of the COVID-CNS study.ConclusionsDespite challenges, this evaluation has demonstrated the critical role of PPI within studies, particularly in this case, for strengthening understanding of how to alleviate the burden for patients of post-COVID-19 sequelae.

"ChatGPT and other large language models (LLMs) have the potential to significantly disrupt common educational practices and assessments, given their capability to quickly generate human-like text in response to user prompts. LLMs GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 have been tested against many standardized and high-stakes assessment materials (e.g. SAT, Uniform Bar Exam, GRE), demonstrating impressive but variable performance. Fewer studies have examined the performance of ChatGPT on course-level educational materials in ecologically-valid grading contexts. Here, we examine the performance of GPT-3.5 on undergraduate course materials and assess the ability of teaching assistants to identify AI-generated responses interleaved with student work. GPT-3.5 was prompted to respond to questions drawn from undergraduate neuroscience assessments. These AI-generated responses were interleaved with student-authored responses and graded blindly using existing course rubrics. In addition, a subset of responses were rated for their humanlikeness by teaching assistants who were blind to author status (AI vs. student). In general, GPT-3.5 performed within one standard deviation of the class average, but there were cases in which ChatGPT-generated responses substantially outperformed or underperformed relative to student responses. Teaching assistants who were blind to author status were able to identify ChatGPT-generated responses with better than chance accuracy, and those with personal experience using ChatGPT were significantly more accurate than those without ChatGPT experience.

"Within the framework of morphogenesis of complex systems proposed by Turing, Hely, and Lesne-Bourgine, we modeled the growth of the dendritic shape of the anterior piriform cortex (aPC) pyramidal cells within the first 2 weeks of the postnatal period of development. We used agent-based modeling with three diffusion models (microtubule-associated protein 2, tubulin, and calcium) and mathematical equations to represent the dendritic growth of developing neurons. We adjusted the timing and distribution of dendritic growth to fit experimental data from the literature. We first simulate the dendritic growth of aPC pyramidal cells adjusted to postnatal day (PND) 1, on which a group of neurons was simulated mimicking the development of dendritic growth from PND 1–7 (phase 1) and from PND 7 to 14 (phase 2). Our agent-based model produced simulated dendrites that fit the general characteristic morphology (branching and elongation) of actual aPC pyramidal cells. However, the simulation per dendritic layer only fits the morphology of L2 but not the L1b or L1a of the actual pyramidal cell. We discuss these results in the context of morphodynamics neuroscience in complex systems, where the particular characteristics of a neuron’s neighborhood could limit its dendritic growth. Each neighborhood is different for each brain region, and these interactions could define its shape. It could be that microcircuitry, the organization of efferent and afferent connectivity, learning, and contingencies, organizes the shape of a certain brain region.Graphical abstract",Neuroscience,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1140/epjb/s10051-025-00917-2,0
"With the rise of the scientific authority of neuroscience and recent neurotechnological advances, the understanding of the human being and its future is beginning to undergo a radical change. As a result, a normative and existential vacuum is opening and hopes as well as fears about the future are flourishing. Some philosophers are anticipating a broad neuroscientific disenchantment, sociocultural disruption and a new existential anxiety related to the clash of the neuroscientific and humanistic image of humans. Others are expecting the technological and scientific developments to lead to human enhancement and existential emancipation. In the first part of this commentary, I outline these two contrasting responses to the rise of neurocentricism and non-anthropocentrism. In the second part, I argue that the divide between the old anthropocentric paradigm and the emerging neuroscientific is misconceived and that literature and fictional narrative are particularly illustrative of the possibility of integrating scientific materialism with humanism. I use the contemporary literary-philosophical workThe Creative Actby Rick Rubin to show that humanist ideas can indeed cohere with anti-essentialist and neuroscientific notions of personal identity and self and how existential meaning and comfort can be found in a neuroscientifically and deterministically explained world.",Neuroscience,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12152-024-09561-6,0
"People spend a remarkable 30–50% of their awake life thinking about something other than what they are currently doing. These experiences of being ‘off-task’ can be described as spontaneous thought when mental dynamics are relatively flexible. Here we review recent neuroscience developments in this area and consider implications for mental well-being and illness. We provide updated overviews of the roles of the default mode network and large-scale network dynamics, and we discuss emerging candidate mechanisms involving hippocampal memory (sharp-wave ripples, replay) and neuromodulatory (noradrenergic and serotonergic) systems. We explore how distinct brain states can be associated with or give rise to adaptive and maladaptive forms of thought linked to distinguishable mental health outcomes. We conclude by outlining new directions in the neuroscience of spontaneous and off-task thought that may clarify mechanisms, lead to personalized biomarkers and facilitate therapy developments toward the goals of better understanding and improving mental health.",Neuroscience,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1038/s44220-023-00133-w,0

"The paper studies the rise of neuroscience in initial teacher education, paying attention to the relatively recent Australian Government (2023) report titled ‘Strong Beginnings’. In taking up a critical policy sociology lens, we focus on the first priority within the reforms, which is mandating brain science and the ‘brain and learning’ as core curriculum within initial teacher education. The reforms will embed standardised curriculum into initial teacher education and tie this curriculum to graduate teacher standards, bracketed within prescribed texts, ideologies and agendas. The reforms are positioned within the ‘what works’ movement, increasing accreditation and certain types of evidence, and the role and authority of intermediary organisations, including the Australian Institute for Teaching and School Leadership (AITSL). It promotes research that has been paid for by the think tank Centre for Independent Studies and aligned with the Australian Education Research Organisation and Education Endowment Foundation. In this paper, we endeavour to highlight how the singular and narrow focus on brain-based approaches is not only reductionist, but also potentially generative of oppressive technologies. The mandating of standardised curriculum and brain science undermines educators, including initial teacher educators, and bolsters private interests in education. The standardisation of core curriculum, which will be tied to accreditation processes and graduate teacher standards, is underpinned by a punitive-accountability based approach. Furthermore, whilst it is less visible, these reforms contain brain science tropes redolent of eugenics and deficit framings of low socio-economic status students.",Neuroscience,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13384-024-00743-y,0

"During the past decade, cognitive neuroscience has been calling for population diversity to address the challenge of validity and generalizability, ushering in a new era of population neuroscience. The developing Chinese Color Nest Project (devCCNP, 2013–2022), the first ten-year stage of the lifespan CCNP (2013–2032), is a two-stages project focusing on brain-mind development. The project aims to create and share a large-scale, longitudinal and multimodal dataset of typically developing children and adolescents (ages 6.0–17.9 at enrolment) in the Chinese population. The devCCNP houses not only phenotypes measured by demographic, biophysical, psychological and behavioural, cognitive, affective, and ocular-tracking assessments but also neurotypes measured with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of brain morphometry, resting-state function, naturalistic viewing function and diffusion structure. This Data Descriptor introduces the first data release of devCCNP including a total of 864 visits from 479 participants. Herein, we provided details of the experimental design, sampling strategies, and technical validation of the devCCNP resource.

"New wearable devices and technologies provide unprecedented scope to augment or substitute human perceptual abilities. However, the flexibility to reorganize brain processing to use novel sensory signals during early sensitive periods in infancy is much less evident at later ages, making integration of new signals into adults’ perception a significant challenge. We believe that an approach informed by cognitive neuroscience is crucial for maximizing the true potential of new sensory technologies. Here, we present a framework for measuring and evaluating the extent to which new signals are integrated within existing structures of perception and experience. As our testbed, we use laboratory tasks in which healthy volunteers learn new, augmented perceptual-motor skills. We describe a suite of measures of (i) perceptual function (psychophysics), (ii) neural representations (fMRI/decoding), and (iii) subjective experience (qualitative interview/micro-phenomenology) targeted at testing hypotheses about how newly learned signals become integrated within perception and experience. As proof of concept, we provide example data showing how this approach allows us to measure changes in perception, neural processing, and subjective experience. We argue that this framework, in concert with targeted approaches to optimizing training and learning, provides the tools needed to develop and optimize new approaches to human sensory augmentation and substitution.",Neuroscience,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s41133-024-00075-7,0

"Gender inequality and diversity in STEM is a challenging field of research. Although the relation between the sex/gender of the researcher and the scientific research practices has been previously examined, less interest has been demonstrated towards the relation between sex/gender of the researcher and the way sex/gender as a variable is explored. Here, we examine, from a neurofeminist perspective, both questions: whether sex/gender identity is related to the examination of sex/gender as a variable and whether different approaches towards examining sex/gender are being used in different topics of study within neuroscience. Using the database of submitted posters to the Organization of Human Brain Mapping 2022 annual conference, we identified abstracts examining a sex/gender-related research question. Among thesetarget abstracts, we identified fouranalytical categories, varying in their degree of content-related complexity: (1)sex/gender as a covariate, (2)sex/gender as a binary variable for the study of sex/gender differences, (3)sex/gender with additional biological information, and (4)sex/gender with additional social information. Statistical comparisons between sex/gender of researcher and the target abstract showed that the proportion of abstracts fromNon-binaryorOtherfirst authors compared to bothWomenandMenwas lower for all submitted abstracts than for the target abstracts; that more researchers with sex/gender-identity other than man implemented analytical category ofsex/gender with additional social information; and, for instance, that research involving cognitive, affective, and behavioural neuroscience more frequently fit into thesex/gender with additional social information-category.

"Social interactions require both the rapid processing of multifaceted socio-affective signals (e.g., eye gaze, facial expressions, gestures) and their integration with evaluations, social knowledge, and expectations. Researchers interested in understanding complex social cognition and behavior face a “black box” problem: What are the underlying mental processes rapidly occurring between perception and action and why are there such vast individual differences? In this review, we promote electroencephalography (EEG) microstates as a powerful tool for both examining socio-affective states (e.g., processing whether someone is in need in a given situation) and identifying the sources of heterogeneity in socio-affective traits (e.g., general willingness to help others). EEG microstates are identified by analyzing scalp field maps (i.e., the distribution of the electrical field on the scalp) over time. This data-driven, reference-independent approach allows for identifying, timing, sequencing, and quantifying the activation of large-scale brain networks relevant to our socio-affective mind. In light of these benefits, EEG microstates should become an indispensable part of the methodological toolkit of laboratories working in the field of social and affective neuroscience.",Neuroscience,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10548-023-00987-4,0

First, three types of EEG signals, including time-invariant EEG, accurate event-related EEG, and random event-related EEG, are introduced. Second, five main directions for the methods of EEG analysis, including power spectrum analysis, time–frequency analysis, connectivity analysis, source localization methods, and machine learning methods, are described in the main section, along with different sub-methods and effect evaluations for solving the same problem. Finally, the application scenarios of different EEG analysis methods are emphasized, and the advantages and disadvantages of similar methods are distinguished.

"Neuroimaging data analysis relies on normalization to standard anatomical templates to resolve macroanatomical differences across brains. Existing human cortical surface templates sample locations unevenly because of distortions introduced by inflation of the folded cortex into a standard shape. Here we present the onavg template, which affords uniform sampling of the cortex. We created the onavg template based on openly available high-quality structural scans of 1,031 brains—25 times more than existing cortical templates. We optimized the vertex locations based on cortical anatomy, achieving an even distribution. We observed consistently higher multivariate pattern classification accuracies and representational geometry inter-participant correlations based on onavg than on other templates, and onavg only needs three-quarters as much data to achieve the same performance compared with other templates. The optimized sampling also reduces CPU time across algorithms by 1.3–22.4% due to less variation in the number of vertices in each searchlight.",Neuroscience,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1038/s41592-024-02346-y,0
"Teaching soft skills like team dynamics and critical thinking in content-heavy higher education curriculum can be challenging.

Escape rooms provide the opportunity for a group to work together as they solve puzzles within a limited time. The skills harnessed and developed within the game by participants are parallel to these soft skills. The present study sought to design a neuroscience-themed physical escape room for the purpose of soft skills development and obtain feedback from undergraduate biomedical or health science students following the completion of the room. Likert-type scale statements in the feedback survey regarding the enjoyability, teamwork development and critical thinking within the game scored positively. Unsurprisingly, the recurring positive theme in the qualitative responses collected revolved around how participants found the activity fun and how it encouraged them to think critically.

"According to recent discussion, cross-explanatory integration in cognitive science might proceed by constraints on mechanistic and dynamic-mechanistic models provided by different research fields. However, not much attention has been given to constraints that could be provided by the study of first-person experience, which in the case of multifaceted mental phenomena are of key importance. In this paper, we fill this gap and consider the question whether information about first-person experience can constrain dynamic-mechanistic models and what the character of this relation is. We discuss two cases of such explanatory models in neuroscience, namely that of migraine and of epilepsy. We argue that, in these cases, first-person insights about the target phenomena significantly contributed to explanatory models by shaping explanatory hypotheses and by indicating the dynamical properties that the explanatory models of these phenomena should account for, and thus directly constraining the space of possible explanations.",Neuroscience,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11229-023-04396-9,0
"Epidemiological evidence has shown that the regular ingestion of vegetables and fruits is associated with reduced risk of developing chronic diseases.

"This article integrates quantitative and qualitative approaches to examine the intersection between religious experience and psychosis. Drawing on empirical data from a study of 130 Christian individuals with and without schizophrenia, as well as a detailed qualitative case study of ‘Yvonne’ (a pseudonym used to protect the identity of the case subject), this paper offers a framework for practitioners seeking to interpret religiously themed psychotic phenomena through both theological and clinical lenses. The study found that religiosity can both protect against and exacerbate psychotic distress, depending on its interpretation and the community’s response. Yvonne’s narrative, marked by episodes interpreted alternately as spiritual warfare and as psychotic expression, illustrates the continuum between religious experience and psychosis. The proposed model of biopsychospiritual integration situates dopamine dysregulation and attribution theory within a theological anthropology that views religious and biological processes as interdependent dimensions of the same human reality of experience.

This paper argues that, even if compatibilism is false, ACT’s account of free will implies that, for us, neuroscience’s growing predictive power is epistemically irrelevant to whether we have free will in the sense that it can provide us only unquantifiable epistemic risk regarding whether we have it.

"Understanding how our sensory apparatus generates percepts and coherent experiences of the world has been the outstanding quest of centuries. Throughout history, philosophers, biologists, psychologists, and – in the past few decades—cognitive neuroscientists have all sought answers to how our brain generates thinking and feeling, behavior, and consciousness. In this contribution, we discuss a bias that has, by and large, characterized this quest, namely a spatial approach towards understanding the neural correlates and mechanisms of cognition. In what follows, we critically assess the spatial emphasis in the study of the brain and cognitive functions. In our historical account of this emphasis, we point to tacit assumptions and limitations of this scientific approach.

"BackgroundOvarian hormone fluctuations over the rodent estrous cycle and the human menstrual cycle are known to significantly impact brain physiology and disease risk, yet this variable is largely ignored in preclinical neuroscience research, clinical studies, and psychiatric practice.MethodsTo assess the importance of the estrous cycle information for the analysis of sex differences in neuroscience research, we re-analyzed our previously published data with or without the estrous cycle information, giving a side-by-side comparison of the analyses of behavior, brain structure, gene expression, and 3D genome organization in female and male mice. We also examined and compared the variance of female and male groups across all neurobehavioral measures.ResultsWe show that accounting for the estrous cycle significantly increases the resolution of the neuroscience studies and allows for: (a) identification of masked sex differences; (b) mechanistic insight(s) into the identified sex differences, across different neurobehavioral outcomes, from behavior to molecular phenotypes. We confirm previous findings that female data from either mixed- or staged-female groups are, on average, not more variable than that of males. However, we show that female variability is not, at all, predictive of whether the estrous cycle plays an important role in regulating the outcome of interest.ConclusionsWe argue that “bringing back” the estrous cycle variable to the main stage is important in order to enhance the resolution and quality of the data, to advance the health of women and other menstruators, and to make research more gender-inclusive. We strongly encourage the neuroscience community to incorporate the estrous cycle information in their study design and data analysis, whenever possible, and we debunk some myths that tend to de-emphasize the importance and discourage the inclusion of this critically important biological variable.HighlightsOvarian hormone fluctuation impacts brain physiology and is a major psychiatric risk factor, yet this variable has been overlooked in neuroscience research and psychiatric practice.From rodent behavior to gene regulation, accounting for the estrous cycle increases the resolution of the neuroscience data, allowing identification and mechanistic insight(s) into sex differences.Female variability does not equal (and is not predictive of) the estrous cycle effect and should not be used as a proxy for the effects of ovarian hormones on the outcome of interest.Neuroscience researchers are advised to incorporate the estrous cycle information in their studies to foster more equitable, female- and gender-inclusive research.Studies of the ovarian cycle are especially important for improving women’s mental health.",Neuroscience,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s13293-022-00466-8,0
"In this paper I have chosen the topic of psychoanalysis in the age of neuroscience, with the aim of showing why the cultural history of psychoanalysis still matters.

In this regard, there is presently a significant predominance of biological ideologies and practices regarding the treatment of mental illness, which implies an increase in the interest in etiology, nosology, definitions, and the effectivity of treatments. Even so, those psychoanalytic historians and/or analysts among us who are committed to psychoanalysis and its therapeutic implications, irrespective of what drugs might be prescribed and what the research findings might conclude, believe that patients still want to be listened to in depth and always will.

"This paper formalizes biological intelligence as search efficiency in multi-scale problem spaces, aiming to resolve epistemic deadlocks in the basal “cognition wars” unfolding in the Diverse Intelligence research program. It extends classical work on symbolic problem-solving to define a novelproblem space lexiconandsearch efficiency metric. Construed as an operationalization of intelligence, this metric is the decimal logarithm of the ratio between the cost of a random walk and that of a biological agent. Thus, the search efficiency measures how many orders of magnitude of dissipative work an agentic policy saves relative to a maximal-entropy search strategy. Empirical models for amoeboid chemotaxis and barium-induced planarian head regeneration show that, under conservative (i.e., intelligence-underestimating) assumptions, even ‘simple’ organisms are from two-hundred- to sextillion-fold more efficient in problem space exploration. In this sense, the deep insights of neuroscience are not about neuronsper se, but about the policies and patterns of physics and mathematics that function as a kind of “cognitive glue” binding parts toward higher levels of collective intelligence in wholes of highly diverse composition and origin. Therefore, our synthesis argues that the “mark of the cognitive” is perhaps better sought in the measurable efficiency with which living systems, from single cells to complex organisms, traverse energy and information gradients to tame combinatorial explosions-one problem space at a time.",Neuroscience,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11229-025-05319-6,0

"Artificial intelligence (AI) researchers currently believe that the main approach to building more general model problems is the big AI model, where existing neural networks are becoming deeper, larger and wider. We term this the big model with external complexity approach. In this work we argue that there is another approach called small model with internal complexity, which can be used to find a suitable path of incorporating rich properties into neurons to construct larger and more efficient AI models. We uncover that one has to increase the scale of the network externally to stimulate the same dynamical properties. To illustrate this, we build a Hodgkin–Huxley (HH) network with rich internal complexity, where each neuron is an HH model, and prove that the dynamical properties and performance of the HH network can be equivalent to a bigger leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) network, where each neuron is a LIF neuron with simple internal complexity.",Neuroscience,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1038/s43588-024-00674-9,0
"Purpose of ReviewHeadache is a common symptom in the Neuroscience Intensive Care Unit (NeuroICU). Our goal is to provide an overview of approaches to headache management for common neurocritical care conditions.Recent FindingsHeadache disorders afflict nearly half of patients admitted to the NICU. Commonly encountered disorders featuring headache include cerebrovascular disease, trauma, and intracranial infection. Approaches to pain are highly variable, and multimodal pain regimens are commonly employed. The overall body of evidence supporting therapeutic strategies to manage headache in the critical care setting is slim, and pain control remains suboptimal in many cases with persistent reliance on opioids.SummaryHeadache is a complex, frequently occurring phenomenon in the NeuroICU care setting.

"The Neuroscience Monoclonal Antibody Sequencing Initiative (NeuroMabSeq) is a concerted effort to determine and make publicly available hybridoma-derived sequences of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) valuable to neuroscience research. Over 30 years of research and development efforts including those at the UC Davis/NIH NeuroMab Facility have resulted in the generation of a large collection of mouse mAbs validated for neuroscience research. To enhance dissemination and increase the utility of this valuable resource, we applied a high-throughput DNA sequencing approach to determine immunoglobulin heavy and light chain variable domain sequences from source hybridoma cells. The resultant set of sequences was made publicly available as a searchable DNA sequence database (neuromabseq.ucdavis.edu) for sharing, analysis and use in downstream applications. We enhanced the utility, transparency, and reproducibility of the existing mAb collection by using these sequences to develop recombinant mAbs. This enabled their subsequent engineering into alternate forms with distinct utility, including alternate modes of detection in multiplexed labeling, and as miniaturized single chain variable fragments or scFvs. The NeuroMabSeq website and database and the corresponding recombinant antibody collection together serve as a public DNA sequence repository of mouse mAb heavy and light chain variable domain sequences and as an open resource for enhancing dissemination and utility of this valuable collection of validated mAbs.",Neuroscience,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1038/s41598-023-43233-4,0
"Science texts have the potential to influence how people make decisions. In recent years, there has been an increased demand for research that helps illuminate how individuals read science texts. Educators seek to develop ways of supporting students as strong readers of science texts. Neuroimaging technology can be an important tool used to understand how individuals read science texts. This technology can inform how educators develop pedagogy; however, it can be difficult to determine how to apply neuroscience technology to educational environments in appropriate ways. One pathway forward is to develop interdisciplinary research collaborations between neuroimaging researchers and science educators. The intersection of neuroscience and education research may allow the technology of neuroimaging to be used in meaningful ways within education. Interdisciplinary partnerships between neuroscience and education can be strengthened by examining study design. When researchers collaborate across the fields of neuroscience and education, flaws in study design can be corrected before research begins. This article presents several factors to consider when designing research that connects neuroimaging and disciplinary literacy in science. By reflecting on the recommendations presented in this article, neuroimaging scientists and science educators may be able to create study designs that have significant implications for classroom settings.",Neuroscience,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s43545-022-00583-6,0
"Addiction, or substance use disorder, is a complex relapsing disorder that affect millions of individuals worldwide (United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime. 2023; SAMHSA2022). The disease stems from recreational use of euphorigenic substances as diverse as psychostimulants (cocaine, amphetamine), narcotics (morphine, oxycodone, fentanyl), cannabinoids, alcohol or more recent synthetic drugs of abuse (Gilpin2023; Kaye et al.2023). In some cases (Maldonado et al.2021), occasional use switches to a compulsive drug taking with loss-of-control over drug use. Vulnerable individuals then enter a vicious cycle where intoxication episodes are followed by a highly aversive withdrawal state, leading to a craving phase with increasing desire for the drug, which typically causes the next intoxication episode (Koob and Volkow2010; Stewart et al.2019). As the brain adapts to repeated exposure to the drug, negative affect gradually overrides the positive subjective of the drug (Koob2020), and maintaining abstinence represents a major defy for affected individuals (Beaulieu et al.2021; Parvaz et al.2022). Molecular determinants and the neurocircuitry of addiction are intensively investigated since decades, and have addressed all stages of the vicious cycle (Darcq and Kieffer2018; Koob and Volkow2016; Volkow and Blanco2021; Nestler and Luscher2019), however prevention, diagnostic and treatment still remain insufficient. The recent opioid epidemics, originally triggered by opioid over prescription for pain treatment (Marshall et al.2019; Volkow and Blanco2021; Volkow et al.2019), has even more increased the need for innovative and personalized approaches to diagnostic and treatment, using the most advanced tools in neuroscience and mental health research.",Neuroscience,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00702-024-02763-5,0

"Recent global data show that cancers of the digestive system are responsible for approximately one-third of all cancer-related deaths worldwide, underscoring the urgent need for innovative therapeutic strategies. In this context, emerging findings from neuroscience may unveil new avenues for tackling this pressing clinical problem. Over the past few years, rapid progress in cancer neuroscience has increasingly underscored the contribution of the nervous system to the development and progression of digestive tract tumors. Research has shown that the specialized neural network of the gastrointestinal tract establishes a framework for reciprocal interactions with digestive tract tumors. On this anatomical foundation, our review delves into the functional significance of these interactions, emphasizing the bidirectional regulatory pathways between the nervous system and tumor cells during disease progression and highlighting their intricate crosstalk with the immune microenvironment. In particular, it maps the molecular pathways by which both the central and peripheral nervous systems (PNS) modulate tumor initiation and progression. Moreover, it explains how neurotransmitters and neuroendocrine mediators drive tumor expansion through the activation of canonical oncogenic signaling cascades and the remodeling of the immunosuppressive microenvironment. This review seeks to elucidate the molecular underpinnings of neuro-immune-tumor crosstalk and to synthesize the latest neural-targeted therapeutic approaches. It also examines the principal obstacles that are impeding the clinical implementation of these interventions. By presenting an integrated overview, this work serves as a robust resource to inform future studies on neurobiological mechanisms and the development of novel therapies for gastrointestinal malignancies.",Neuroscience,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12943-025-02412-9,0
"Open access to rodent cognitive data has lagged behind the rapid generation of large open-access datasets in other areas of neuroscience, such as neuroimaging and genomics. One contributing factor has been the absence of uniform standardization in experiments and data output, an issue that has particularly plagued studies in animal models. Touchscreen-automated cognitive testing of animal models allows standardized outputs that are compatible with open-access sharing. Touchscreen datasets can be combined with different neuro-technologies such as fiber photometry, miniscopes, optogenetics, and MRI to evaluate the relationship between neural activity and behavior. Here we describe a platform that allows deposition of these data into an open-access repository. This platform, called MouseBytes, is a web-based repository that enables researchers to store, share, visualize, and analyze cognitive data. Here we present the architecture, structure, and the essential infrastructure behind MouseBytes. In addition, we describe MouseBytes+, a database that allows data from complementary neuro-technologies such as imaging and photometry to be easily integrated with behavioral data in MouseBytes to support multi-modal behavioral analysis.",Neuroscience,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1038/s41597-023-02106-1,0
"To further enhance the understanding of video education, researchers have started leveraging neuroscientific approaches to investigate the underlying cognitive processes and their correlation with learning outcomes. This concise review begins by examining recent behavioral studies that focus on teachers, students, and video media within the video education context. The findings from these studies provide valuable insights into the overall paradigm and design. Moreover, this review explores the potential of single-brain research and the emerging multi-brain scanning approach to shed light on the neural mechanisms involved in video learning. Current research has mostly used electroencephalography (EEG) to detect different brainwave frequency changes when single learners watch videos, as well as functional magnetic resonance or EEG to discover the extent to which the coupling of brain activity between instructional subjects in video-based instruction predicts learning outcomes. These novel approaches hold great promise in determining the cognitive processes implicated in video education and may eventually lead to more personalized and effective learning methods. By synthesizing the current state of research, this review aims to contribute to the ongoing discussions in the field and inspire further investigations into the neuroscientific aspects of video education.",Neuroscience,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11528-024-00946-1,0
"PurposeTo evaluate the effectiveness, compared with usual care, of an interactive online group programme combining pain neuroscience education (PNE) and graded exposure to movement (GEM) for improving quality of life and pain experience in breast cancer survivors with chronic pain.MethodsThis single-blind randomised controlled trial included a sample of 49 breast cancer survivors who were randomly assigned to two groups (experimental:n= 22 and control:n= 27). The experimental group received a 12-week person-centred online programme based on pain neuroscience education and therapeutic yoga as gradual exposure to movement, while the control group continued with their usual care. The primary outcome was quality of life (FACT–B + 4); the secondary outcomes were related to the experience of chronic pain (pain intensity, pain interference, catastrophizing, pain self-efficacy, kinesiophobia, and fear avoidance behaviours). All variables were assessed at four time points (T0, baseline; T1, after PNE sessions; T2, after yoga sessions; T3, at 3-month follow-up). For data analysis, ANOVA (2 × 4) analysis of variance (95% CI) was used when outcomes were normally distributed. If not, within-group and between-group comparisons were calculated.ResultsThirty-six participants were included in the analysis (control group, 22; experimental group, 14). A significant time * group effect was observed in favour of the experimental group regarding the global quality of life score (p= 0.010,ηp2= 0.124). Significant differences in favour of the experimental group were observed for pain intensity, pain interference, catastrophizing, and pain self-efficacy. These differences persisted at follow-up.ConclusionsAn online intervention based on PNE and GEM appears to be more effective than usual care for improving quality of life in breast cancer survivors with chronic pain, as a time per group interaction was reported. In addition, the intervention also significantly improved the participants’ experience of chronic pain. However, due to the study limitations further research is needed.Trial record:NCT04965909 (26/06/2021).",Neuroscience,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00520-024-08887-4,0

"PurposesTo optimize the efficacy of analgesia and post-operative recovery for patients undergoing laparoscopic colorectal surgery by integrating a composite psycho-somatic analgesia algorithm involving peri-operative rehabilitation exercise and pain neuroscience education into multi-modal analgesia.MethodsA prospective randomized controlled trial was conducted to compare conventional peri-operative analgesia (group CA) and the addition of rehabilitation exercise and pain neuroscience education into it (group REPNE) for patients undergoing laparoscopic colorectal surgery. Acute and chronic post-operative pain, characteristics of pain (pain catastrophizing, sensitization, and trends of neuropathic transformation), and quality of post-operative recovery calibrated with EuroQol Five Dimensions Questionnaire (EQ-5D-5L) were investigated and compared between two groups.ResultsA total of 175 patients consented to participate in this study. Compared with those receiving conventional analgesia (group CA,N =89), patients in group REPNE (N =86) reported reduced intensity of pain 24 h after surgery, less risk of pain catastrophizing and sensitization, and better quality of life during hospitalization recovery till 1 month after surgery (p <0.05). No statistical difference was found for neuropathic transformation of post-operative pain or for the incidence of chronic post-operative pain (p >0.05).ConclusionsThe addition of peri-operative rehabilitation exercise and pain neuroscience education into multi-modal analgesia provided better analgesic effect compared with routine practice for patients receiving laparoscopic colorectal surgery and also facilitated better post-operative recovery.

"Suspension and imaging cytometry techniques that simultaneously measure hundreds of cellular features are powering a new era of cell biology and transforming our understanding of human tissues and tumors. However, a central challenge remains in learning the identities of unexpected or novel cell types. Cell identification rubrics that could assist trainees, whether human or machine, are not always rigorously defined, vary greatly by field, and differentially rely on cell intrinsic measurements, cell extrinsic tissue measurements, or external contextual information such as clinical outcomes. This challenge is especially acute in the context of tumors, where cells aberrantly express developmental programs that are normally time, location, or cell-type restricted. Well-established fields have contrasting practices for cell identity that have emerged from convention and convenience as much as design. For example, early immunology focused on identifying minimal sets of protein features that mark individual, functionally distinct cells. In neuroscience, features including morphology, development, and anatomical location were typical starting points for defining cell types. Both immunology and neuroscience now aim to link standardized measurements of protein or RNA to informative cell functions such as electrophysiology, connectivity, lineage potential, phospho-protein signaling, cell suppression, and tumor cell killing ability. The expansion of automated, machine-driven methods for learning cell identity has further created an urgent need for a harmonized framework for distinguishing cell identity across fields and technology platforms. Here, we compare practices in the fields of immunology and neuroscience, highlight concepts from each that might work well in the other, and propose ways to implement these ideas to study neural and immune cell interactions in brain tumors and associated model systems.",Neuroscience,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00281-022-00976-y,0
"Brain disorders pose a substantial global health challenge, persisting as a leading cause of mortality worldwide. Electroencephalogram (EEG) analysis is crucial for diagnosing brain disorders, but it can be challenging for medical practitioners to interpret complex EEG signals and make accurate diagnoses. To address this, our study focuses on visualizing complex EEG signals in a format easily understandable by medical professionals and deep learning algorithms. We propose a novel time–frequency (TF) transform called the Forward–Backward Fourier transform (FBFT) and utilize convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to extract meaningful features from TF images and classify brain disorders. We introduce the concept of eye-naked classification, which integrates domain-specific knowledge and clinical expertise into the classification process. Our study demonstrates the effectiveness of the FBFT method, achieving impressive accuracies across multiple brain disorders using CNN-based classification. Specifically, we achieve accuracies of 99.82% for epilepsy, 95.91% for Alzheimer’s disease (AD), 85.1% for murmur, and 100% for mental stress using CNN-based classification. Furthermore, in the context of naked-eye classification, we achieve accuracies of 78.6%, 71.9%, 82.7%, and 91.0% for epilepsy, AD, murmur, and mental stress, respectively. Additionally, we incorporate a mean correlation coefficient (mCC) based channel selection method to enhance the accuracy of our classification further. By combining these innovative approaches, our study enhances the visualization of EEG signals, providing medical professionals with a deeper understanding of TF medical images. This research has the potential to bridge the gap between image classification and visual medical interpretation, leading to better disease detection and improved patient care in the field of neuroscience.",Neuroscience,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1038/s41598-024-54416-y,0
"Nearly all psychiatric diseases involve alterations in subjective, lived experience. The scientific study of the biological basis of mental illness has generally focused on objective measures and observable behaviors, limiting the potential for our understanding of brain mechanisms of disease states and possible treatments. However, applying methods designed principally to interpret objective behavioral measures to the measurement and extrapolation of subjective states presents a number of challenges. In order to help bridge this gap, we draw on the tradition of phenomenology, a philosophical movement concerned with elucidating the structure of lived experience, which emerged in the early 20th century and influenced philosophy of mind, cognitive science, and psychiatry. A number of early phenomenologically-oriented psychiatrists made influential contributions to the field, but this approach retreated to the background as psychiatry moved towards more operationalized disease classifications. Recently, clinical-phenomenological research and viewpoints have re-emerged in the field. We argue that the potential for phenomenological research and methods to generate productive hypotheses about the neurobiological basis of psychiatric diseases has thus far been underappreciated. Using specific examples drawing on the subjective experience of mania and psychosis, we demonstrate that phenomenologically-oriented clinical studies can generate novel and fruitful propositions for neuroscientific investigation. Additionally, we outline a proposal for more rigorously integrating phenomenological investigations of subjective experience with the methods of modern neuroscience research, advocating a cross-species approach with a key role for human subjects research. Collaborative interaction between phenomenology, psychiatry, and neuroscience has the potential to move these fields towards a unified understanding of the biological basis of mental illness.",Neuroscience,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1038/s41380-022-01891-2,0
"Task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) reveals individual differences in neural correlates of cognition but faces scalability challenges due to cognitive demands, protocol variability, and limited task coverage in large datasets. Here, we propose DeepTaskGen, a deep-learning approach that synthesizes non-acquired task-based contrast maps from resting-state (rs-) fMRI. We validate this approach using the Human Connectome Project lifespan data, then generate 47 contrast maps from 7 different cognitive tasks for over 20,000 individuals from UK Biobank. DeepTaskGen outperforms several benchmarks in generating synthetic task-contrast maps, achieving superior reconstruction performance while retaining inter-individual variation essential for biomarker development.

"Purpose: The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of pain neuroscience education compared to biomedical pain education after breast cancer surgery on (1) work status, (2) time until work resumption, and (3) change in return-to-work expectations up to 18 months post-surgery. Methods: Participants were randomly assigned to either pain neuroscience education (intervention group) or biomedical pain education (control group) in addition to a standard physical therapy program after surgery for breast cancer. The first four months following surgery, one to two physiotherapy sessions and three educational sessions were scheduled. After, two educational sessions and two physiotherapy sessions were held at six and eight months postoperatively. All outcomes were assessed at four, six, eight, 12 and 18 months postoperatively. Results: At 12 months, in the intervention group, 71% of the women returned to work compared to 53% in the control group (18% points difference, 95%CI:-0.1 to 35;p = 0.07). At 18 months, the differences decreased to 9% points, 95%CI:-26 to 7;p = 0.35). Neither time until work resumption (p = 0.46) nor change in estimation of own ability to return to work up to 18 months postoperatively (p = 0.21) significantly differed between both groups. Conclusion: No significant differences were found regarding return to work outcomes between women receiving pain neuroscience education versus biomedical pain education after breast cancer surgery. Further research is warranted to explore the potential role of pain neuroscience education in return-to-work interventions following breast cancer surgery.",Neuroscience,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10926-023-10103-9,0

"Faces convey critical information for social communication, such as identity, expression, and eye gaze. Unfortunately, individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) often experience difficulties in processing this information, and these deficits lead to their suffering from social interactions. Importantly, since face processing is a social skill developed during early childhood, its deficits may be an early symptom of ASD. In recent years, researchers have made great progress in identifying face processing impairments in individuals with ASD and exploring their biological underpinnings. In this paper, we reviewed the research progress on face processing impairments in individuals with ASD. Moreover, we mainly summarized the mechanisms proposed to underlie these impairments, including the changes in brain structure and function, atypical social cognition, and genetic variation. Finally, we discussed the factors leading to the inconsistent results of existing studies. Focused efforts to research the alterations and mechanisms of face processing might improve our knowledge of this complex, heterogeneous neurodevelopmental disorder. The ultimate purpose is to help clinical diagnosis and treatment, thereby improving the function of individuals with ASD.",Neuroscience,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11571-025-10321-2,0
"Neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative diseases involve critical abnormalities in pathogenesis. Even though there exists copious drugs and treatments, still a need for an effective model for absolute replication of disease pathophysiology and therapeutic drug discovery. This comprehensive systematic review amasses methods and approaches for developing neuronal models for neurological diseases using hPSCs/iPSCs. Abundant culturing methods, growth factors, modulators and toxins were utilised to induce the disease and were appraised. Research articles were traced from Google Scholar, PubMed/NIH, and Science Direct. Publications using hPSCs/iPSCs as differentiated neuronal disease models were screened using PRISMA guidelines, with designed inclusion and exclusion criteria. This protocol highlights the procedures for developing 2D and 3D neuronal models derived from hPSCs/iPSCs. 2D neuronal models include NPCs, NSCs, and neural rosettes, neurons, while 3D methods rely on embryoid bodies, neurospheres, spheroids and organoids due to the enhanced differentiation, survival and maturation of hPSCs/iPSCs. These processes include varied factors for culturing. Growth factors like GDNF, BDNF, cAMP, ascorbic acid, TGF-β, and Dual-SMAD inhibition. Post-analytical techniques like MEA, H&E, TEM, microscopy, immunoassays, and electrophysiology ensures the structural and functional endorsements. These models offer researchers a reliable platform to investigate the disease physiopathology and drug design for neurological disorders.Graphical Abstract",Neuroscience,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12015-025-11022-3,0
"In this paper, findings from research in neuroscience of morality will be reviewed to consider the purposes of moral education. Particularly, I will focus on two main themes in neuroscience, novel neuroimaging and experimental investigations, and Bayesian learning mechanism. First, I will examine how neuroimaging and experimental studies contributed to our understanding of psychological mechanisms associated with moral functioning while addressing methodological concerns. Second, Bayesian learning mechanism will be introduced to acquire insights about how moral learning occurs in human brains. Based on the reviewed neuroscientific research on morality, I will examine how evidence can support the model of moral education proposed by virtue ethics, Neo-Aristotelian moral philosophy in particular. Particularly, two main aims of virtue ethics-based moral education, the habituation of virtues and the cultivation of phronesis, will be discussed as the important purposes of moral education based on neuroscientific evidence.",Neuroscience,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10677-023-10369-1,0
"The study of complex behaviors is often challenging when using manual annotation due to the absence of quantifiable behavioral definitions and the subjective nature of behavioral annotation. Integration of supervised machine learning approaches mitigates some of these issues through the inclusion of accessible and explainable model interpretation. To decrease barriers to access, and with an emphasis on accessible model explainability, we developed the open-source Simple Behavioral Analysis (SimBA) platform for behavioral neuroscientists. SimBA introduces several machine learning interpretability tools, including SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) scores, that aid in creating explainable and transparent behavioral classifiers. Here we show how the addition of explainability metrics allows for quantifiable comparisons of aggressive social behavior across research groups and species, reconceptualizing behavior as a sharable reagent and providing an open-source framework. We provide an open-source, graphical user interface (GUI)-driven, well-documented package to facilitate the movement toward improved automation and sharing of behavioral classification tools across laboratories.",Neuroscience,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1038/s41593-024-01649-9,0

"PurposeDespite the different benefits of formative assessments in an integrated medical curriculum, the effective strategies to provide feedback to medical students to benefit from the different merits of formative assessment are not fully understood. This study aims to determine the effect of different strategies of formative feedback on students’ outcomes in a medical neuroscience course.MethodWe compared medical students’ performance in summative examinations in the academic year that formative feedback was provided using in-person discussion and compared such performances with the academic year when the feedback was provided by written rationales or a combination of written rationales and in-person discussion. We also surveyed medical students’ preferences for whether written or in-person formative feedback is a better strategy to provide feedback at the end of each course.ResultsANOVA found a significant difference in summative performance scores for those scoring ≥ 70% when formative feedback was provided by providing a rationale, in-person, and a combination of both ([F(2,80) = 247.60,P< 0.001]. Post hoc analysis revealed a significant and highest performance when feedback was provided using the written rationale approach (***P< 0.05), followed by in-person (**P< 0.05). In contrast, the least performance was recorded when formative feedback was provided using a combination of providing a written rationale for the answers to the questions and in-person discussion of the questions (*P< 0.05). Students’ preferred approach for receiving formative feedback for their formative assessment was highest for written rationale (***P< 0.05), followed by in-person or a combination of in-person and written rationale (**P< 0.05).ConclusionOur results found that medical students preferred a written formative feedback approach, which was associated with better student performance on the summative examination. This study reveals the importance of developing effective strategies to provide formative feedback to medical students for medical students to fully benefit from the merits of formative assessment in an integrated medical school curriculum.",Neuroscience,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40670-023-01801-3,0
"Artificial, de-novo manufactured materials (with controlled nano-sized characteristics) have been progressively used by neuroscientists during the last several decades. The introduction of novel implantable bioelectronics interfaces that are better suited to their biological targets is one example of an innovation that has emerged as a result of advanced nanostructures and implantable bioelectronics interfaces, which has increased the potential of prostheses and neural interfaces. The unique physical–chemical properties of nanoparticles have also facilitated the development of novel imaging instruments for advanced laboratory systems, as well as intelligently manufactured scaffolds and microelectrodes and other technologies designed to increase our understanding of neural tissue processes.

We demonstrate a practical application to the public repository of neural reconstructions, NeuroMorpho.Org, thus expanding the existing web-based metadata management system currently in use. Quantitative analysis indicates that the suggestion system reduces personnel labor by at least 50%.

"This paper reviews the utility of zebrafish (Danio rerio) as a model system for exploring neurobehavioral phenomena in preclinical research, focusing on physiological processes, disorders, and neurotoxicity biomarkers. A comprehensive review of the current literature was conducted to summarize the various behavioral characteristics of zebrafish. The study examined the etiological agents used to induce neurotoxicity and the biomarkers involved, including Aβ42, tau, MMP-13, MAO, NF-Кβ, and GFAP. Additionally, the different zebrafish study models and their responses to neurobehavioral analysis were discussed. The review identified several key biomarkers of neurotoxicity in zebrafish, each impacting different aspects of neurogenesis, inflammation, and neurodegeneration. Aβ42 was found to alter neuronal growth and stem cell function. Tau’s interaction with tubulin affected microtubule stability and led to tauopathies under pathological conditions. MMP-13 was linked to oxidative assault and sensory neuron degeneration. MAO plays a role in neurotransmitter metabolism and neurotoxicity conversion. NF-Кβ was involved in pro-inflammatory pathways, and GFAP was indicative of neuroinflammation and astroglial activation. Zebrafish provide a valuable model for neurobehavioral research, adhering to the “3Rs” philosophy. Their neurotoxicity biomarkers offer insights into the mechanisms of neurogenesis, inflammation, and neurodegeneration. This model system aids in evaluating physiological and pathological conditions, enhancing our understanding of neurobehavioral phenomena and potential therapeutic interventions.",Neuroscience,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00210-024-03275-5,0
"The medical curriculum is charged with training medical students who can possess both the technical and contextual abilities to adapt to the transformational world of medicine. This new objective would require incorporating engineering principles into the medical curriculum, which was formed by the University of Illinois as the Carle Illinois College of Medicine. As a fully integrated engineering based medical school, students partake in active learning modules that develop their quantitative, innovative, and entrepreneurship skills. An example of the active learning component of the curriculum is the “Neuroscience Engineering Challenge Lab.” The purpose of this study was to explore students’ perception of the lab and learn how the active-learning curriculum via the design thinking labs can be enhanced. Using a paired samplesttest of pre- and post-survey results, we found that the students did not statistically gain a better understanding of the design thinking process (p= 0.052), which is expected due to the majority of students having an engineering background. Contrarily, the lab increased students’ understanding of ideation tools (p= 0.003), user-centered design concepts (p= 0.004), preparing a business plan pitch (p= 0.027), and students felt better prepared for their IDEA and Capstone project (p= 0.010). Based on the results, students are becoming more confident with understanding, experience, and applying these specific tools and skills. Therefore, the medical curriculum should provide opportunities for students to develop and apply their innovation skills through active-learning activities such as a Neuroscience Engineering Challenge Lab.",Neuroscience,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40670-022-01676-w,0

"BackgroundPractice guidelines recommend that patients with intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) be treated in units with acute neuroscience care experience. However, most hospitals in the United States lack this degree of specialization. We sought to examine outcome differences for patients with nontraumatic ICH presenting to centers with and without advanced neuroscience care specialization.MethodsThis was a retrospective study of adult patients presenting with nontraumatic ICH between 1/1/2011 and 9/30/2020 across 21 medical centers within Kaiser Permanente Northern California, an integrated care system that employs a “hub-and-spoke” model of neuroscience care in which two centers service as neuroscience “hubs” and the remaining 19 centers service as referral “spokes.” Patients presenting to spokes can receive remote consultation (including image review) by neurosurgical or neurointensive care specialists located at hubs. The primary outcome was 90-day mortality. We used hierarchical logistic regression, adjusting for ICH score components, comorbidities, and demographics, to test a hypothesis that initial presentation to a spoke medical center was noninferior to hub presentation [defined as an odds ratio (OR) with an upper 95% confidence interval (CI) limit of 1.24 or less].ResultsA total of 6978 patients were included, with 6170 (88%) initially presenting to spoke medical centers. The unadjusted 90-day mortality for patients initially presenting to spoke versus hub medical centers was 32.2% and 32.7%, respectively. In adjusted analysis, presentation to a spoke medical center was neither noninferior nor inferior for 90-day mortality risk (OR 1.21, 95% CI 0.84–1.74). Sensitivity analysis excluding patients admitted to general wards or lacking continuous health plan insurance during the follow-up period trended closer to a noninferior result (OR 0.99, 95% CI 0.69–1.44).ConclusionsWithin an integrated “hub-and-spoke” neuroscience care model, the risk of 90-day mortality following initial presentation with nontraumatic ICH to a spoke medical center was not conclusively noninferior compared with initial presentation to a hub medical center. However, there was also no indication that care for selected patients with nontraumatic ICH within medical centers lacking advanced neuroscience specialization resulted in significantly inferior outcomes. This finding may support the safety and efficiency of a “hub-and-spoke” care model for patients with nontraumatic ICH, although additional investigations are warranted.",Neuroscience,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12028-022-01667-0,0

"The philosophical interest in experimental practice in neuroscience has brought renewed attention to the study of the development and use of techniques and tools for data production. John Bickle has argued that the construction and progression of theories in neuroscience are entirely dependent on the development and ingenious use of research tools. In Bickle's account, theory plays a tertiary role, as it depends on what the tools allow researchers to manipulate, and the tools, in turn, are developed not in order to test theories but as solutions to engineering problems. However, Bickle's account is not entirely precise in explaining what informs researchers' decision-making in their atheoretical laboratory tinkering. Identifying the sources that guide researchers in tool development and use is crucial if one wishes to contribute to the philosophical or meta-scientific understanding of experimental practice in neuroscience. In the following paper, I claim that decision-making in tools' development and use in neuroscience is doubly guided. Pre-existing theory and concepts determine information's relevance, whereas tools' functioning in controlled situations determines information's reliability. Accordingly, experimenters' decision-making is situated both in the context of analysing, modelling or interpreting information and in the context of producing information. I study the case of the tungsten microelectrode developed by David Hubel during the 1950s. First, I show that pre-existing theory and concepts (in particular, the ""neuron doctrine"" and the concepts of ""receptive field"" and ""cortical column"") determine in advance what information would be relevant to obtain from the microelectrode. Second, I show that Hubel's tinkering follows the guidelines derived from the very structure of what we recognise as reliable experimentally produced information. Finally, I suggest that data-production processes allow experimenters to assess what to expect from an experimental system in terms of concept- and theory-generation and confirmation, thereby endorsing Bickle's tenet on the tertiary role of theory in neuroscience.",Neuroscience,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11229-022-03934-1,0
"Comprehending speech with the existence of background noise is of great importance for human life. In the past decades, a large number of psychological, cognitive and neuroscientific research has explored the neurocognitive mechanisms of speech-in-noise comprehension. However, as limited by the low ecological validity of the speech stimuli and the experimental paradigm, as well as the inadequate attention on the high-order linguistic and extralinguistic processes, there remains much unknown about how the brain processes noisy speech in real-life scenarios. A recently emerging approach, i.e., the second-person neuroscience approach, provides a novel conceptual framework. It measures both of the speaker’s and the listener’s neural activities, and estimates the speaker-listener neural coupling with regarding of the speaker’s production-related neural activity as a standardized reference. The second-person approach not only promotes the use of naturalistic speech but also allows for free communication between speaker and listener as in a close-to-life context. In this review, we first briefly review the previous discoveries about how the brain processes speech in noise; then, we introduce the principles and advantages of the second-person neuroscience approach and discuss its implications to unravel the linguistic and extralinguistic processes during speech-in-noise comprehension; finally, we conclude by proposing some critical issues and calls for more research interests in the second-person approach, which would further extend the present knowledge about how people comprehend speech in noise.",Neuroscience,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11571-022-09924-w,0

"Many neurological diseases involving tissue damage cannot be treated with drug-based approaches, and the inaccessibility of human brain samples further hampers the study of these diseases. Human pluripotent stem cells (PSCs), including embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), provide an excellent model for studying neural development and function. PSCs can be differentiated into various neural cell types, providing a renewal source of functional human brain cells. Therefore, PSC-derived neural cells are increasingly used for multiple applications, including neurodevelopmental and neurotoxicological studies, neurological disease modeling, drug screening, and regenerative medicine. In addition, the neural cells generated from patient iPSCs can be used to study patient-specific disease signatures and progression. With the recent advances in genome editing technologies, it is possible to remove the disease-related mutations in the patient iPSCs to generate corrected iPSCs. The corrected iPSCs can differentiate into neural cells with normal physiological functions, which can be used for autologous transplantation. This review highlights the current progress in using PSCs to understand the fundamental principles of human neurodevelopment and dissect the molecular mechanisms of neurological diseases. This knowledge can be applied to develop better drugs and explore cell therapy options. We also discuss the basic requirements for developing cell transplantation therapies for neurological disorders and the current status of the ongoing clinical trials.Graphical Abstract",Neuroscience,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12015-025-10851-6,0
"Statistical errors in preclinical science are a barrier to reproducibility and translation. For instance, linear models (e.g., ANOVA, linear regression) may be misapplied to data that violate assumptions. In behavioral neuroscience and psychopharmacology, linear models are frequently applied to interdependent or compositional data, which includes behavioral assessments where animals concurrently choose between chambers, objects, outcomes, or types of behavior (e.g., forced swim, novel object, place/social preference). The current study simulated behavioral data for a task with four interdependent choices (i.e., increased choice of a given outcome decreases others) using Monte Carlo methods. 16,000 datasets were simulated (1000 each of 4 effect sizes by 4 sample sizes) and statistical approaches evaluated for accuracy. Linear regression and linear mixed effects regression (LMER) with a single random intercept resulted in high false positives (>60%). Elevated false positives were attenuated in an LMER with random effects for all choice-levels and a binomial logistic mixed effects regression. However, these models were underpowered to reliably detect effects at common preclinical sample sizes. A Bayesian method using prior knowledge for control subjects increased power by up to 30%. These results were confirmed in a second simulation (8000 datasets). These data suggest that statistical analyses may often be misapplied in preclinical paradigms, with common linear methods increasing false positives, but potential alternatives lacking power. Ultimately, using informed priors may balance statistical requirements with ethical imperatives to minimize the number of animals used. These findings highlight the importance of considering statistical assumptions and limitations when designing research studies.",Neuroscience,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1038/s41386-023-01592-6,0
"With the development of science and technology, nanomaterials, especially superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs), aroused great interests of researcher due to their special performance. SPIONs below 10 nm had good superparamagnetism, excellent magnetic field response which widely applied in biomedical field. Researchers had developed a variety of methods for synthesizing SPIONs. However, nanoscale magnetic materials tended to agglomerate and oxidized due to their high surface energy and high surface metal chemical activity; as a result, the magnetic properties and dispersibility of the SPIONs were reduced. Moreover, naked SPIONs possessed poor biocompatibility. Hence, it was necessary for surface modification of SPIONs in practical applications. In fact, SPIONs were usually surface coated by various materials to maintain their properties including non-polymeric organic stabilizers, polymeric stabilizers, and inorganic molecules. SPIONs had good dispersibility and biocompatibility after surface treatment. To date, SPIONs had been widely used in biomedical fields including magnetron therapy, magnetic hyperthermia, MRI, biological separation, and catalysis. Neurological conditions were the second leading cause of death globally, accounting for 9 million deaths per year. With increasing life stress, the increasing incidence of brain diseases imposes a severe economic burden on society and families. SPIONs owned excellent magnetism which responded superiorly to magnetic fields. In the presence of an external magnetic field, the magnetic nanoparticles are controlled by the magnetic field. More and more attention was fixed on SPIONs in nervous system. In review, recent advances of SPIONs and its applications in neuroscience under external magnetic field were included.",Neuroscience,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13204-023-02803-8,0
"The Learning Assistant (LA) model trains undergraduate student leaders to enhance student learning and engagement by supporting the classroom with research-based instructional strategies. Many disciplines in the life sciences that implemented the LA model reported increased learning gains and decreased performance gaps. However, the model is rarely implemented in engineering disciplines whose students would benefit immensely from having LA guidance in hands-on engineering courses. We illustrate Biomedical Engineering (BME), an engineering discipline whose students struggle to find cohesion between the courses and develop the learning habits they need for a successful career. The two main innovations of our work are (1) the implementation of a discipline-specific LA program for BME students and (2) the development of a neuroscience-inspired pedagogy course to introduce and push students to consider the neural underpinnings of their learning process. We report the implementation mechanics of the program and present preliminary data as success indicators. First, we qualitatively captured the pedagogy course’s impact on the trained LAs using the classroom activities they developed and a self-reflection assignment. Second, we conducted a pilot pre-post-thematic analysis, which revealed increased self-awareness, motivation to learn, and a shift from self to students and team-based learning. Third, we also measured the program’s initial impact on the students who attended LA-supported classes through surveys. The student surveys showed an overall improvement (p< 0.05,n= 217) in the socio-emotional measures contributing to career preparedness, like the sense of belonging, self-efficacy, and STEM identity. All program participants reported a transformative experience in their learning practices, study habits, and classroom dynamics.",Neuroscience,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s43683-023-00123-5,0

"The collective activity of neurons in cortical circuits enables us to think, perceive, learn and move. Modeling this activity through cellular automata (CA) based approaches provides a common mathematical framework for merging, explaining, testing, and anticipating empirical data. This review introduces the CA applications for the dynamic modeling of neuron populations and brain activity. A non-systematic literature search was conducted on the application of CA in modeling neuron populations and brain activity. This paper emphasizes the dynamics of large-scale networks (e.g., as found in the brain) rather than smaller neuronal systems. Publications were identified with different approaches based on CA that examined various aspects related to the nonlinear dynamic properties of one or more neuronal populations corresponding to brain areas. CA models could yield different dynamics from multistability, including limit-cycle as well as fixed-point attractors, to extremely nonlinear dynamics that produce complex aperiodic nonlinear oscillations. It was also shown that a CA model of neuronal populations could yield self-organized criticality as an essential property of neural systems. By integrating various empirical findings from the microscopic to macroscopic level into a mathematical framework that can be refined iteratively, dynamic CA models are suitable tools to explain and interpret complex neural mechanisms involved in perception and behavior. While important challenges remain, evidence from CA models indicates that collective nonlinear dynamics are the main concepts for adaptive cortical activity.",Neuroscience,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s41939-023-00263-9,0
"Space exploration is crucial for understanding our surroundings and establishing scientific concepts to explore, monitor, and save our planet’s environment. However, the response of the human nervous system in the environment of space poses numerous challenges. Brain complexity explains the vulnerability and intrinsic difficulty of recalibration after disturbance. Over the millennia, the brain has evolved to function at 1-G. Studying the brain and its physiology in different environments may shed light on multiple conditions encountered on Earth that are yet to be solved and dictate collaboration at international levels. The nervous system is affected by several stressors due to microgravity, radiation, isolation, disruption of circadian rhythm, impaired sleep dynamics, and hypercapnia associated with space travel. In this article, we aim to review several aspects related to the nervous system in weightless conditions, as well as the development and future of the emerging field of “space neuroscience.” Space neuroscience is a fascinating, embryonic field that requires significant development. The establishment of frameworks for the strategic development of space neuroscience is vital, as more research and collaboration are required to overcome these numerous and diverse challenges, minimize risks, and optimize crew performance during planetary operations.",Neuroscience,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10072-022-06146-0,0
"Recent advances in imaging and tracing technology provide increasingly detailed reconstructions of brain connectomes. Concomitant analytic advances enable rigorous identification and quantification of functionally important features of brain network architecture. Null models are a flexible tool to statistically benchmark the presence or magnitude of features of interest, by selectively preserving specific architectural properties of brain networks while systematically randomizing others. Here we describe the logic, implementation and interpretation of null models of connectomes. We introduce randomization and generative approaches to constructing null networks, and outline a taxonomy of network methods for statistical inference. We highlight the spectrum of null models — from liberal models that control few network properties, to conservative models that recapitulate multiple properties of empirical networks — that allow us to operationalize and test detailed hypotheses about the structure and function of brain networks. We review emerging scenarios for the application of null models in network neuroscience, including for spatially embedded networks, annotated networks and correlation-derived networks. Finally, we consider the limits of null models, as well as outstanding questions for the field.",Neuroscience,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1038/s41583-022-00601-9,0

"Multimodal neuroimaging grants a powerful window into the structure and function of the human brain at multiple scales. Recent methodological and conceptual advances have enabled investigations of the interplay between large-scale spatial trends (also referred to as gradients) in brain microstructure and connectivity, offering an integrative framework to study multiscale brain organization. Here, we share a multimodal MRI dataset for Microstructure-Informed Connectomics (MICA-MICs) acquired in 50 healthy adults (23 women; 29.54 ± 5.62 years) who underwent high-resolution T1-weighted MRI, myelin-sensitive quantitative T1 relaxometry, diffusion-weighted MRI, and resting-state functional MRI at 3 Tesla. In addition to raw anonymized MRI data, this release includes brain-wide connectomes derived from (i) resting-state functional imaging, (ii) diffusion tractography, (iii) microstructure covariance analysis, and (iv) geodesic cortical distance, gathered across multiple parcellation scales. Alongside, we share large-scale gradients estimated from each modality and parcellation scale.

"The
demise of the scholastic worldview and the rise of the mechanistic one may give the impression of a parallel demise of the scholastic explanatory framework. In this paper, I argue that this impression is wrong. To this end, I first outline Descartes’ representative and particularly sharp mechanistic criticism of the scholastic notion of explanation. Deploying conceptual machinery from contemporary philosophy of science, I then suggest a reconstruction of the scholastic notion that is immune to Descartes’ criticism. Based on this reconstruction, I reinterpret the dispute between Descartes and the scholastics as one that concerns the extent of two legitimate conceptions of explanation. Finally, I outline a contemporary dispute within cognitive neuroscience that reflects the Cartesian-scholastic one as thus reinterpreted, thereby showing that aspects of the world may well require a scholastic-like approach for their explanation. The aim of this paper, then, is to shed light on a most important philosophical-cum-scientific historical controversy from a modern perspective, but also to highlight the deep historical roots of a related contemporary dispute. Based on this, the paper also seeks to draw a substantial philosophical conclusion concerning the issue under dispute in both controversies.",Neuroscience,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12136-022-00536-x,0
"Despite the recent increase in second-person neuroscience research, it is still hard to understand which neurocognitive mechanisms underlie real-time social behaviours. Here, we propose that social signalling can help us understand social interactions both at the single- and two-brain level in terms of social signal exchanges between senders and receivers. First, we show how subtle manipulations of being watched provide an important tool to dissect meaningful social signals. We then focus on how social signalling can help us build testable hypotheses for second-person neuroscience with the example of imitation and gaze behaviour. Finally, we suggest that linking neural activity to specific social signals will be key to fully understand the neurocognitive systems engaged during face-to-face interactions.",Neuroscience,https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13423-022-02103-2,0
"Phenomenology is concerned with the first-person experience of or about some object, and is generally related to sensory experience, for example, auditory or visual. Cognitive phenomenology refers to an element of phenomenological experience that does not have a sensory character. Experiences of thought, understanding, and appreciation of meaning are less figurative than the sensory kind and therefore suggest a treatment separate from that related to sensory experience. Where sensory phenomenology is discussed as there being something, it is like to be in a sensory state (of color or some object like a banana), and it is less evident that there is something it is like to think, understand, or recognize meaning. As Strawson [1] puts it: “It’s strange that the existence of cognitive phenomenology is a matter of dispute.” But dispute there is, this paper examines thisThe Nature of Cognitive Phenomenology and Its Denialand suggests instances from neurology and logical argumentation that CP does exist. In this paper, while the existence phenomenal consciousness is a matter of philosophical debate, the CP of understanding is seen as important to those who work on language understanding in a computational domain. The salient method is a critical examination and comparison of relevant literature in different disciplines. Specifically, one instance of cognitive phenomenology is addressed: theunderstanding experience. However, the very existence of cognitive phenomenology is a controversial issue in philosophical discourse. Accordingly, in addition to a presentation of cognitive phenomenology, the controversy over its necessity as a concept is examined: a study dismissing CP is presented, and an example (a phenomenal contrast argument) is introduced. New arguments based on formal examples of “understanding” are proposed to further corroborate the existence of CP. Then, in the light of existing work on event-related potentials that measure changes in brain activity patterns under linguistic input, a neural support for cognitive phenomenology is elicited as an additional proof of its existence. The key result is that arguments from neurology and linguistics provide support for the existence of at least one facet of cognitive phenomenology (understanding)with the possibility that such presence could be measurable and extended to other modes. The arguments presented in the paper provide a grounding for using the CP concept in computing, as a complement to synthetic phenomenology.",Neuroscience,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12559-023-10144-5,0

"BackgroundChronic pain is a pervasive and invisible condition which affects people in a myriad of ways including but not limited to their quality of life, autonomy, mental and physical health, social mobility, and productivity. There are many ethical implications of neuroscience research on chronic pain, given its potential to reduce suffering and improve the lived experience of people in pain. While a growing body of research studies the etiology, neurophysiology, and management of chronic pain, it is unknown to what degree neuroscience research in this area engages with relevant ethics concepts.AimTo explore the presence of ethics concepts in empirical chronic pain neuroscience literature to advance knowledge regarding the ethics of chronic pain management.MethodsWe conducted a hybrid bibliometric analysis and scoping review of chronic pain neuroscience articles published between 1999 and 2021 to identify the presence of ethics concepts. We selected articles from the top, middle, and bottom 20 neuroscience journals ranked by Impact Factor. We conducted a database search of Web of Science and a hand-search using PubMed, Google Scholar, and the reference lists of included articles.FindingsOur database search yielded 2779 results from which 46 articles met inclusion criteria. An additional 13 articles were hand-retrieved using PubMed and Google Scholar in accordance with the inclusion criteria, totaling 59 articles. We identified four main ethics themes in our analysis: 1) Quality of Life (n = 46), 2) Autonomy (n = 5), 3) Transparency (n = 4), and 4) Beneficence and Non-Maleficence (n = 4).ConclusionMost neuroscience papers do not include a discussion of ethics related to chronic pain conditions. Those that do tend to merely state rather than define or contextualize a particular ethics concept. Given the potential ethical implications of neuroscience research for people living with chronic pain, we argue that to maximize its public health benefit, neuroscience researchers should consider the ethical relevance of their work within their scientific publications. This may generate further ethical reflection within the field, to improve pain management.",Neuroscience,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12152-022-09499-7,0
"Although hallucinations are important and frequent symptoms in major psychiatric and neurological diseases, little is known about their brain mechanisms. Hallucinations are unpredictable and private experiences, making their investigation, quantification and assessment highly challenging. A major shortcoming in hallucination research is the absence of methods able to induce specific and short-lasting hallucinations, which resemble clinical hallucinations, can be elicited repeatedly and vary across experimental conditions. By integrating clinical observations and recent advances in cognitive neuroscience with robotics, we have designed a novel device and sensorimotor method able to repeatedly induce a specific, clinically relevant hallucination: presence hallucination. Presence hallucinations are induced by applying specific conflicting (spatiotemporal) sensorimotor stimulation including an upper extremity and the torso of the participant. Another, MRI-compatible, robotic device using similar sensorimotor stimulation permitted the identification of the brain mechanisms of these hallucinations. Enabling the identification of behavioral and a frontotemporal neural biomarkers of hallucinations, under fully controlled experimental conditions and in real-time, this method can be applied in healthy participants as well as patients with schizophrenia, neurodegenerative disease or other hallucinations. The execution of these protocols requires intermediate-level skills in cognitive neuroscience and MRI processing, as well as minimal coding experience to control the robotic device. These protocols take ~3 h to be completed.",Neuroscience,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1038/s41596-022-00737-z,0
"Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) and concussion substantially burden patients, care providers, and society. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention & National Center for Injury Prevention and Control,2010) stated that concussion and brain injury symptoms could persist for days, weeks, or longer, and that recovery can be slower for old individuals, young children, teens, and those with a prior traumatic brain injury (TBI) history. Evidence shows that individuals with mTBI can have delayed recovery with limited community integration and substantial long-term disability. Also, considerable evidence from multiple sources  underscore the association between mTBI and the increased rate of suicide, suicide attempt, and suicide ideation. Yet, according to the New York Academy of Science, there is limited concordance between neurobiological explanations for concussion and neuropsychological functions.  Current medical research is equivocal on the prognosis rate of recovery and duration of mTBI, particularly after many months. While some experts suggest that those not showing signs of improvement are a distinct group of patients that have “intentional” TBI symptoms (e.g., for litigation and disability entitlement purposes), many individuals genuinely suffer from sensory dysfunctions months post-TBI. Using an evidence-based approach, we review the relevant literature on the chronic somatosensory dysfunctions emanating from mTBI/concussion, including vestibular dysfunction, and start by presenting a clinical case. It is believed that vestibular dysfunctions (e.g., ataxia, benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), and persistent postural-perceptual dizziness (PPPD), just to name a few), whether due to a central or peripheral lesion and with impact on return to work or to sport that affects roughly half of acute TBI patients, tend to be cryptogenic in nature in chronic TBI cases. In forensic detailed evaluations, it is often challenging to separate the cognitive impact of mTBI from the vestibular issues alone. Furthermore, assessment of vestibular dysfunction (e.g., dizziness, vertigo, nystagmus, imbalance, and persistent nausea), diagnostic criteria, neurocognitive consequences, psychiatric comorbidities with psychological impacts, and treatment approaches (e.g., pharmacotherapy and rehabilitation), with emphasis on implications for neuropsychological assessment practice, and future research guideline are discussed.

"The Hawkes process models have been recently become a popular tool for modeling and analysis of neural spike trains. In this article, motivated by neuronal spike trains study, we propose a novel multivariate generalized linear Hawkes process model, where covariates are included in the intensity function. We consider the problem of simultaneous variable selection and estimation for the multivariate generalized linear Hawkes process in the high-dimensional regime. Estimation of the intensity function of the high-dimensional point process is considered within a nonparametric framework, applying B-splines and the SCAD penalty for matters of sparsity. We apply the Doob-Kolmogorov inequality and the martingale central limit theory to establish the consistency and asymptotic normality of the resulting estimators.

"BackgroundComputer-assisted learning has been suggested to improve enjoyment and learning efficacy in medical education and more specifically, in neuroscience. These range from text-based websites to interactive electronic modules (eModules). It remains uncertain how these can best be implemented. To assess the effects of interactivity on learning perceptions and efficacy, we compared the utility of an eModule using virtual clinical cases and graphics against a Wikipedia-like page of matching content to teach clinical neuroscience: fundamentals of stroke and cerebrovascular anatomy.MethodsA randomized control trial of using an interactive eModule versus a Wikipedia-like page without interactivity was performed. Participants remotely accessed their allocated learning activity once, for approximately 30 min. The primary outcome was the difference in perceptions on enjoyability, engagement and usefulness. The secondary outcome was the difference in learning efficacy between the two learning activities. These were assessed using a Likert-scale survey and two knowledge quizzes: one immediately after the learning activity and one repeated eight weeks later. Assessments were analysed using Mann–Whitney U and T-tests respectively.ResultsThirty-two medical students participated: allocated evenly between the two groups through randomisation. The eModule was perceived as significantly more engaging (p= 0.0005), useful (p= 0.01) and enjoyable (p= 0.001) by students, with the main contributing factors being interactivity and clinical cases. After both learning activities, there was a significant decrease between the first and second quiz scores for both the eModule group (-16%,p= 0.001) and Wikipedia group (-17%,p= 0.003). There was no significant difference in quiz scores between the eModule and Wikipedia groups immediately afterwards (86% vs 85%,p= 0.8) or after eight weeks (71% vs 68%,p= 0.7).ConclusionOur study shows that increased student satisfaction associated with interactive computer-assisted learning in the form of an eModule does not translate into increased learning efficacy as compared to using a Wikipedia-like webpage. This suggests the matched content of the passive webpage provides a similar learning efficacy. Still, eModules can help motivate self-directed learners and overcome the perceived difficulty associated with neuroscience. As computer assisted learning continues to rapidly expand among medical schools, we suggest educators critically evaluate the usage and cost–benefit of eModules.",Neuroscience,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12909-022-03578-2,0
"We reviewed publicly available information from the top 50 journals worldwide in psychology and neuroscience to infer the proportions of editors by gender and country of affiliation. In both fields, the proportions of male and female editors differed significantly, both across editorial roles and within various role categories. Moreover, for 76% of psychology journals and 88% of neuroscience journals more than 50% of editors were male, whereas only 20% and 10%, respectively, had a similar proportion of female editors. US-based academics outnumbered those from other countries as editors in both psychology and neuroscience beyond what would be expected from approximate rates of senior psychology and neuroscience scholars worldwide.

"Brain networks exist within the confines of resource limitations. As a result, a brain network must overcome the metabolic costs of growing and sustaining the network within its physical space, while simultaneously implementing its required information processing. Here, to observe the effect of these processes, we introduce the spatially embedded recurrent neural network (seRNN). seRNNs learn basic task-related inferences while existing within a three-dimensional Euclidean space, where the communication of constituent neurons is constrained by a sparse connectome. We find that seRNNs converge on structural and functional features that are also commonly found in primate cerebral cortices. Specifically, they converge on solving inferences using modular small-world networks, in which functionally similar units spatially configure themselves to utilize an energetically efficient mixed-selective code. Because these features emerge in unison, seRNNs reveal how many common structural and functional brain motifs are strongly intertwined and can be attributed to basic biological optimization processes. seRNNs incorporate biophysical constraints within a fully artificial system and can serve as a bridge between structural and functional research communities to move neuroscientific understanding forwards.",Neuroscience,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1038/s42256-023-00748-9,0
"We aimed to investigate some variables associated with the fact that educators do or do not attribute relevance to the connection between neuroscience and education. Also, we analyzed how they include this knowledge in their pedagogical practice. A total of 1643 educators completed an online survey and were assigned into two groups: educators no knowledge (NK) in neuroscience and those with knowledge (WK). The main data indicated that 69.4% of those in the WK group considered it fundamental to understand human behavior compared to 38.9% in the NK group. For teaching methods, 83% of the NK group agreed that conventional teaching methods are superior to those that include knowledge in neuroscience, in contrast to 19% in the WK group. These findings indicate the relevance of consistent neuroscience training for education professionals to transpose the research results on brain functioning by seeking more innovative educational practices.",Neuroscience,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s43076-022-00169-4,0

"In the article “What are neural correlates neural correlates of?” published in the journalBioSocieties, Gabriel Abend points out that neuroscientists cannot avoid philosophical questions concerning the conceptualization and operationalization of social-psychological phenomena they deal with at the physiological level. In this article, we build on Abend’s thesis and, through a systematic literature review of decision neuroscience studies, test it with the example of the social-psychological phenomenon of uncertainty in decision making. In this paper, we provide an overview of studies that appropriately attempt to conceptualise uncertainty, and then use these studies to analyse papers looking for neural correlates of uncertainty. Based on a systematic review of studies, we investigate what types of uncertainty authors in the field of decision neuroscience address and define, what criteria they use to distinguish between these types, what problems are associated with their conceptualization, and whether the neural correlates of different types of uncertainty can be accurately identified. The paper concludes that, particularly in the economic context, a collaboration between the natural and social sciences works well, and neuroscience studies use economic conceptualizations of uncertainty that are further developed by sophisticated decision tasks. However, the paper also highlights problematic aspects that obscure the understanding of the phenomena under study. These include the lack of criteria for distinguishing between different types of phenomena, the unclear use of the general concept of uncertainty, and the confusion of phenomena or their erroneous synonymous use.",Neuroscience,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12124-022-09719-y,0
"BackgroundLow back pain (LBP) is a multifactorial disorder associated with a high range of physical and psychological burden on the society. Patient-led goal-setting approach has shown potential effects for improving chronic LBP. However, there are few studies investigating its benefits when combined with a supplementary intervention. This paper, therefore, presents a protocol for a randomized control trial (RCT) to study the effect of a patient-led goal-setting approach combined with pain neuroscience education (PNE) or manual therapy (MT) among patients with chronic LBP.MethodsA total of 105 patients suffering from chronic LBP will be recruited via flyers displayed in hospitals and universities, and those meeting the study’s criteria will randomly be allocated into a patient-led goal-setting approach with the PNE group, and/or with the MT program group, and/or a control group. The primary outcomes will be the pain intensity and disability. Secondary outcomes include quality of life, depression, anxiety and stress, fear avoidance beliefs, kinesophobia, pain self-efficacy, catastrophic pain, neurophysiology of pain, and central sensitivity. All the outcomes will be recorded at 2 months after receiving the treatment as post-test sessions and after 4 and 12 months as follow-up sessions. The Ethics Committee in Research at Sport Sciences Research Institute of Iran approved the protocol of this trial (IR.SSRC.REC.1400.084).

"Systems neuroscience is focused on how ensemble properties in the brain, such as the activity of neuronal circuits, gives rise to internal brain states and behavior. Many of the studies in this field have traditionally involved electrophysiological recordings and computational approaches that attempt to decode how the brain transforms inputs into functional outputs. More recently, systems neuroscience has received an infusion of approaches and techniques that allow the manipulation (e.g., optogenetics, chemogenetics) and imaging (e.g., two-photon imaging, head mounted fluorescent microscopes) of neurons, neurocircuits, their inputs and outputs. Here, we will review novel approaches that allow the manipulation and imaging of specific molecular mechanisms in specific cells (not just neurons), cell ensembles and brain regions. These molecular approaches, with the specificity and temporal resolution appropriate for systems studies, promise to infuse the field with novel ideas, emphases and directions, and are motivating the emergence of a molecularly oriented systems neuroscience, a new discipline that studies how the spatial and temporal patterns of molecular systems modulate circuits and brain networks, and consequently shape the properties of brain states and behavior.",Neuroscience,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s13041-021-00885-5,0
"Reverse inference is a crucial inferential strategy used in cognitive neuroscience to derive conclusions about the engagement of cognitive processes from patterns of brain activation. While widely employed in experimental studies, it is now viewed with increasing scepticism within the neuroscience community. One problem with reverse inference is that it is logically invalid, being an instance of abduction in Peirce’s sense. In this paper, we offer the first systematic analysis of reverse inference as a form of abductive reasoning and highlight some relevant implications for the current debate. We start by formalising an important distinction that has been entirely neglected in the literature, namely the distinction between weak (strategic) and strong (justificatory) reverse inference. Then, we rely on case studies from recent neuroscientific research to systematically discuss the role and limits of both strong and weak reverse inference; in particular, we offer the first exploration of weak reverse inference as a discovery strategy within cognitive neuroscience.",Neuroscience,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11229-022-03585-2,0

"Understanding neural computation on the mechanistic level requires models of neurons and neuronal networks. To analyze such models one typically has to solve coupled ordinary differential equations (ODEs), which describe the dynamics of the underlying neural system. These ODEs are solved numerically with deterministic ODE solvers that yield single solutions with either no, or only a global scalar error indicator on precision. It can therefore be challenging to estimate the effect of numerical uncertainty on quantities of interest, such as spike-times and the number of spikes. To overcome this problem, we propose to use recently developed sampling-based probabilistic solvers, which are able to quantify such numerical uncertainties. They neither require detailed insights into the kinetics of the models, nor are they difficult to implement. We show that numerical uncertainty can affect the outcome of typical neuroscience simulations, e.g. jittering spikes by milliseconds or even adding or removing individual spikes from simulations altogether, and demonstrate that probabilistic solvers reveal these numerical uncertainties with only moderate computational overhead.",Neuroscience,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10827-022-00827-7,0

"Experiments in cognitive neuroscience build a setup whose set of controlled stimuli and rules elicits a cognitive process in a participant. This setup requires researchers to decide the value of quite a few parameters along several dimensions. We call ‘’contextual factors’’ the parameters often assumed not to change the cognitive process elicited and are free to vary across the experiment’s repetitions. Against this assumption, empirical evidence shows that many of these contextual factors can significantly influence cognitive performance. Nevertheless, it is not entirely clear what it means for a cognitive phenomenon to be context-sensitive and how to identify context-sensitivity experimentally. We claim that a phenomenon can be context-sensitive either because it is only triggered within a specific context or because different contexts change its manifestation conditions. Assessing which of these forms of context-sensitivity is present in a given phenomenon requires a criterion for individuating it across contextual variations. We argue that some inter-level experiments that, within the mechanistic approach to explanation, are required to identify relations of constitutive relevance between a phenomenon and a mechanism, are also necessary for individuating the phenomenon across its contextual variations. We articulate a criterion according to which behavioral variations across contexts indicate different phenomena if and only if the mechanistic activities, components and/or organizational properties recruited in each context are different. We support this approach by showing how it is applied in paradigmatic studies addressing cognitive performance differences resulting from contextual variations of task features, such as stimulus type and response modality. Finally, we address the challenge that a form of context-sensitivity possessed by the so-called ‘multifunctional mechanisms’ is incompatible with our proposal because it entails that the same mechanism can be recruited in different contexts to produce different phenomena. We examine key cases of multifunctionality and argue that they are consistent with our proposal because a single mechanism can have different components, activities and/or organizational properties in different contexts. Thus, these modifications may not affect the identity of a mechanism, and they could explain how it produced different phenomena in those contexts.",Neuroscience,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11229-022-03870-0,0

"Multiscale modeling techniques have attracted increasing attention by philosophers of science, but the resulting discussions have almost exclusively focused on issues surrounding explanation (e.g., reduction and emergence). In this paper, I argue that besides explanation, multiscale techniques can serve important exploratory functions when scientists model systems whose organization at different scales is ill-understood. My account distinguishes explanatory and descriptive multiscale modeling based on which epistemic goal scientists aim to achieve when using multiscale techniques. In explanatory multiscale modeling, scientists use multiscale techniques to select information that is relevant to explain a particular type of behavior of the target system. In descriptive multiscale modeling scientists use multiscale techniques to explore lower-scale features which could be explanatorily relevant to many different types of behavior, and to determine which features of a target system an upper-scale data pattern could refer to. Using multiscale models from data-driven neuroscience as a case study, I argue that descriptive multiscale models have an exploratory function because they are a sources of potential explanations and serve as tools to reassess our conception of the target system.",Neuroscience,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11229-022-03551-y,0
"The prevention and treatment of addiction (moderate to severe substance use disorder—SUD) have remained challenging because of the dynamic and complex interactions between multiple biological and social determinants that shape SUD. The pharmacological landscape is ever changing and the use of multiple drugs is increasingly common, requiring an unraveling of pharmacological interactions to understand the effects. There are different stages in the trajectory from drug use to addiction that are characterized by distinct cognitive and emotional features. These are directed by different neurobiological processes that require identification and characterization including those that underlie the high co-morbidity with other disorders. Finally, there is substantial individual variability in the susceptibility to develop SUD because there are multiple determinants, including genetics, sex, developmental trajectories and times of drug exposures, and psychosocial and environmental factors including commercial determinants that influence drug availability. Elucidating how these factors interact to determine risk is essential for identifying the biobehavioral basis of addiction and developing prevention and treatment strategies. Basic research is tasked with addressing each of these challenges. The recent proliferation of technological advances that allow for genetic manipulation, visualization of molecular reactions and cellular activity in vivo, multiscale whole brain mapping across the life span, and the mining of massive data sets including multimodality human brain imaging are accelerating our ability to understand how the brain functions and how drugs influence it.

"The youth self-report version of the Child and Adolescent Dispositions Scale (CADS) measures three orthogonal temperament dimensions that are hypothesized to dispose children and adolescents to develop psychological problems through transactions with the environment. The CADS was developed using exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses (CFA) of ratings of a pool of items from which synonyms and antonyms of DSM symptoms were excluded in two population-based samples. The criterion validity of the resulting three CADS dimensions of negative emotionality, prosociality, and daring has been well established in multiple samples. We examined the factor structure and criterion validity correlations of the CADS using data on 14.0–18.0 year olds in the English community based Neuroscience in Psychiatry 2400 Study. Using CFA, the three hypothesized CADS factors were identified, which were validated by their predicted cross-cutting correlations with measures of anxiety, depression, and conduct problems. Nonetheless, the fit of the CFA was not acceptable, likely because the expectation of simple structure in CFA was not met. The same data were re-analyzed using exploratory structural equation modeling (ESEM) to identify sources of poor fit. Two of the three fit indices suggested acceptable fit for the three-factor ESEM solution (Standardized Root Mean-Square Residual = 0.047; Root Mean-Square Error of Approximation = 0.067; Comparative Fit Index = 0.878). If replicated in other samples, these results suggest that some prosociality items with cross-loadings on more than one factor should be considered for elimination or replacement to improve the measurement of these dispositional dimensions.",Neuroscience,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10862-024-10153-0,0

"AbstractThe lymphatic system not only plays an important role as a
drainage eliminating metabolic wastes and toxins from tissues, but
also represents an arena for the unfolding of immune response scenarios
aimed at protecting the organism from bacteria and viruses. In the
central nervous system (CNS), drainage processes proceed with the
same intensity as in peripheral tissues. The brain actively exchanges
nutrients with the blood and excretes metabolic waste products through
the drainage routes closely related to the peripheral lymphatic
system. The same routes allow the traffic of immune cells and antibodies
to the CNS, thus providing a communication between the peripheral
and central immune systems. Over the bicentennial history of brain
drainage studies, a lot of facts have been accumulated to suggest
indirectly the presence of lymphatic vessels in the CNS. However,
even with the advent of high-tech imaging of brain structures and
a rediscovery of the meningeal lymphatic vessels (MLVs), which was
a watershed in neuroscience, scientists have not advanced beyond
confirming the already existing dogma that the lymphatic network
is present exclusively in the brain meninges, but not in brain tissues.
In fact, however, the rediscovery of MLVs by American scientists
was not a “true revelation”, as they were first described by the
Italian anatomist Mascagni two centuries earlier, and his results
were confirmed later on in many other studies performed on the meninges
in humans, macaques, rodents, dogs, rabbits and zebrafish. As a result,
the scientific community did not recognize the “forgotten” MLVs
as a new discovery. This review highlights the turning points that
occurred in neuroscience when a new player has entered the game
and orchestrated innumerable efforts of scientists to explain how
unnecessary molecules and toxins are removed from the brain, as
well as how drainage and immunity are implemented in the CNS. This
is an important informational and creative platform both for new
fundamental knowledge about the lymphatic system in the brain, as
well as for the development of innovative neurorehabilitation technologies
based on the management of lymphatic drainage processes.",Neuroscience,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1134/S0022093023010015,0

"The brain is an extraordinarily complex system that facilitates the optimal integration of information from different regions to execute its functions. With the recent advances in technology, researchers can now collect enormous amounts of data from the brain using neuroimaging at different scales and from numerous modalities. With that comes the need for sophisticated tools for analysis. The field of network neuroscience has been trying to tackle these challenges, and graph theory has been one of its essential branches through the investigation of brain networks. Recently, topological data analysis has gained more attention as an alternative framework by providing a set of metrics that go beyond pairwise connections and offer improved robustness against noise. In this hands-on tutorial, our goal is to provide the computational tools to explore neuroimaging data using these frameworks and to facilitate their accessibility, data visualisation, and comprehension for newcomers to the field. We will start by giving a concise (and by no means complete) overview of the field to introduce the two frameworks and then explain how to compute both well-established and newer metrics on resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging. We use an open-source language (Python) and provide an accompanying publicly available Jupyter Notebook that uses the 1000 Functional Connectomes Project dataset. Moreover, we would like to highlight one part of our notebook dedicated to the realistic visualisation of high order interactions in brain networks. This pipeline provides three-dimensional (3-D) plots of pairwise and higher-order interactions projected in a brain atlas, a new feature tailor-made for network neuroscience.",Neuroscience,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00429-021-02435-0,0
"Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a maladaptive and debilitating psychiatric disorder, characterized by re-experiencing, avoidance, negative emotions and thoughts, and hyperarousal in the months and years following exposure to severe trauma. PTSD has a prevalence of approximately 6–8% in the general population, although this can increase to 25% among groups who have experienced severe psychological trauma, such as combat veterans, refugees and victims of assault. The risk of developing PTSD in the aftermath of severe trauma is determined by multiple factors, including genetics — at least 30–40% of the risk of PTSD is heritable — and past history, for example, prior adult and childhood trauma. Many of the primary symptoms of PTSD, including hyperarousal and sleep dysregulation, are increasingly understood through translational neuroscience. In addition, a large amount of evidence suggests that PTSD can be viewed, at least in part, as a disorder that involves dysregulation of normal fear processes. The neural circuitry underlying fear and threat-related behaviour and learning in mammals, including the amygdala–hippocampus–medial prefrontal cortex circuit, is among the most well-understood in behavioural neuroscience. Furthermore, the study of threat-responding and its underlying circuitry has led to rapid progress in understanding learning and memory processes. By combining molecular–genetic approaches with a translational, mechanistic knowledge of fear circuitry, transformational advances in the conceptual framework, diagnosis and treatment of PTSD are possible. In this Review, we describe the clinical features and current treatments for PTSD, examine the neurobiology of symptom domains, highlight genomic advances and discuss translational approaches to understanding mechanisms and identifying new treatments and interventions for this devastating syndrome.",Neuroscience,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1038/s41582-022-00635-8,0

"Since antiquity human taste has been divided into 4–5 taste qualities. We realized in the early 1970s that taste qualities vary between species and that the sense of taste in species closer to humans such as primates should show a higher fidelity to human taste qualities than non-primates (Brouwer et al. in J Physiol 337:240, 1983). Here we present summary results of behavioral and single taste fiber recordings from the distant South American marmoset, through the Old World rhesus monkey to chimpanzee, the phylogenetically closest species to humans. Our data show that in these species taste is transmitted in labelled-lines to the CNS, so that when receptors on taste bud cells are stimulated, the cell sends action potentials through single taste nerve fibers to the CNS where they create taste, whose quality depends on the cortical area stimulated. In human, the taste qualites include, but are perhaps not limited to sweet, sour, salty, bitter and umami. Stimulation of cortical taste areas combined with inputs from internal organs, olfaction, vision, memory etc. leads to a choice to accept or reject intake of a compound. The labelled-line organization of taste is another example of Müller’s law of specific nerve energy, joining other somatic senses such as vision (Sperry in J Neurophysiol 8:15–28, 1945), olfaction (Ngai et al. in Cell 72:657–666, 1993), touch, temperature and pain to mention a few.",Neuroscience,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12868-024-00847-2,0

"Following the levels of intentionality and semiosis distinguished by the Semiotic Hierarchy (a layered model of semiosis/intentionality), and the distinction between original agency (without the use of artefacts) and enhanced agency (the prosthetic incorporation of artefacts), we propose a model of an agency hierarchy, consisting of six layers. Consistent with the phenomenological orientation of cognitive semiotics, a central claim is that agency and subjectivity are complementary aspects of intentionality. Hence, there is no agency without at least the minimal sense/feeling of agency. This perspective rules out all artefacts as genuine agents, as well as simple organisms, since it is highly unlikely that e.g. bacteria have any first-person perspective. Using this model, we review and assess recent proposals on the nature of agency from cognitive science, and neuroscience, and draw conclusions on how to incorporate aspects of them within a synthetic cognitive-semiotic framework.",Neuroscience,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12304-022-09473-z,0

"Deliberating on the state of the science underlying the prediction of dangerousness and the application of that science is a weight carried by the law. Over the past few decades new technologies have allowed neuroscience to document intricacies of the developing brain. As neuroscience has expanded and refined the evidence of biopsychosocial influences on brain development, neurolaw has considered the implications of the scientific research for criminal law. Assigning an age for the onset of adulthood is a sociolegal construct. Science cannot assign an exact age to adulthood. Neuroscience has established that brain development continues through the mid-twenties, but exposure to adverse childhood experiences, perinatal exposures and conditions, and genetic pre-disposition to mental illness changes this trajectory so that neither the course nor endpoints are fixed. The Court holds the responsibility to apply the law to an individual set of circumstances but often asks psychiatrists what factors help explain an individual’s actions or state of mind and to apply the science and the art of medicine to help explain the individual. However, a psychiatrist’s testimony is a tool used by attorneys to further an argument. Is the law ready to accept the neuroscience of emerging adulthood and does it meet Daubert are ever-evolving question and answer sets as studies are repeated and the evidence mounts regarding brain development. Even so, at the end of the day, what psychiatrists know to be true or science accepts to be fact is not the same as policy or law. Many other factors are at play.",Neuroscience,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40817-021-00116-8,0
"Sex differences exist in many neurological and psychiatric diseases, but these have not always been addressed adequately in research. In order to address this, it is necessary to consider how sex is incorporated into the design (e.g. using a balanced design) and into the analyses (e.g. using sex as a covariate) in the published literature. We surveyed papers published in 2009 and 2019 across six journals in neuroscience and psychiatry. In this sample, we find a 30% increase in the percentage of papers reporting studies that included both sexes in 2019 compared with 2009. Despite this increase, in 2019 only 19% of papers in the sample reported using an optimal design for discovery of possible sex differences, and only 5% of the papers reported studies that analysed sex as a discovery variable. We conclude that progress to date has not been sufficient to address the importance of sex differences in research for discovery and therapeutic potential for neurological and psychiatric disease.",Neuroscience,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1038/s41467-022-29903-3,0
"Purpose of ReviewThe study sought to assess the prevalence of physician burnout among interventional pain physicians in 2022.Recent FindingsPhysician burnout is major psychosocial and occupational health issue. Prior to the coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, over 60% of physicians reported emotional exhaustion and burnout. Physician burnout was reported to become more prevalent in multiple medical specialties during the COVID-19 pandemic.SummaryAn 18-question survey was distributed electronically to all ASPN members (n = 7809) in the summer of 2022 to assess demographics, burnout characteristics (e.g., Have you felt burned out due to COVID?), and strategies to cope with burnout and stress (e.g., reached out for mental health assistance). Members were able to complete the survey once and were unable to make changes to their responses once submitted. Descriptive statistics were used to assess the prevalence and severity of physician burnout within the ASPN community. Chi-square tests were used to examine differences in burnout by provider characteristics (age, gender, years practicing, and practice type) with p-values less than 0.05 indicating statistical significance. There were 7809 ASPN members that received the survey email, 164 of those members completed the survey, a response rate of 2.1%. The majority of respondents were male (74.1%, n = 120), 94% were attending physicians (n = 152), and 26% (n = 43) have been in practice for twenty years or longer. Most respondents expressed having experienced burnout during the COVID pandemic (73.5%, n = 119), 21.6% of the sample reported reduced hours and responsibilities during the pandemic, and 6.2% of surveyed physicians quit or retired due to burnout. Nearly half of responders reported negative impacts to their family and social lives as well as personal physical and mental health. A variety of negative (e.g., changes in diet, smoking/vaping) and positive coping strategies (e.g., exercise and training, spiritual enrichment) were employed in response to stress and burnout; 33.5% felt they should or had reached out for mental health assistance and suicidal ideations were expressed in 6.2% due to burnout. A high percentage of interventional pain physicians continue to experience mental symptoms that may lead to risk for significant issues going forward. Our findings should be interpreted with caution based on the low response rate. Evaluation of burnout should be incorporated into annual assessments given issues of survey fatigue and low survey response rates. Interventions and strategies to address burnout are warranted.",Neuroscience,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11916-023-01121-6,0
"PurposeThe understanding of cognitive symptoms in patients with IDH-Mutant gliomas (IDH-Mut) is rapidly developing. In this article, we summarize the neuroscientific knowledge base regarding the influence of IDH-Mut tumors and their treatment on cognition and provide guidance regarding the management of these symptoms in patients.MethodsWe performed a review of peer reviewed publications relevant to IDH-Mut glioma and cognitive outcomes and provide an overview of the literature as well as a case example to clarify management strategies.ResultsAt the time of presentation, patients with IDH-Mut gliomas have a favorable cognitive profile as compared with those with IDH-wild type (WT) tumors. The relatively low cognitive burden may reflect the slower growth rate of IDH-Mut tumors, which is less disruptive to both local and widespread neural networks. Human connectomic research using a variety of modalities has demonstrated relatively preserved network efficiency in patients with IDH-Mut gliomas as compared with IDH-WT tumors. Risk of cognitive decline from surgery can potentially be mitigated by careful integration of intra-operative mapping. Longer term cognitive risks of tumor treatment, including chemotherapy and radiation, are best managed by instituting neuropsychological assessment as part of the long-term care of patients with IDH-Mutant glioma. A specific timeline for such integrative care is provided.ConclusionsGiven the relative recency of the IDH-mutation based classification of gliomas, as well as the long time course of this disease, a thoughtful and comprehensive strategy to studying patient outcomes and devising methods of cognitive risk reduction is required.",Neuroscience,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11060-023-04289-4,0

"This study aims to determine the phenomenological bifurcation (P-bifurcation) occurring in the van der Pol (VDP) neuronal model of burst neurons with a random signal. We observe the P-bifurcation under an intense noise stimulus which would become chaotic transitions. Bursting and spiking simulations are used to describe the causes of chaotic transitions between two periodic phases that are the reason for the neuronal activities. Randomness plays a crucial role in detecting the P-bifurcation. To determine the equilibrium points, stability or instability of the stochastic VDP equation, and bifurcation, we use the stochastic averaging method and some related theorems. Apart from theoretical methods, we also examine numerical simulations in the particular case of that stochastic equation that illustrates the outcome of theorems for various noise types. The most striking part of our theoretical findings is that these results are also valid for the Izhikevich-FitzHugh model, Bonhoeffer-van der Pol oscillator in dynamical systems of neuroscience.

"The human capacity for symbolic representation arises, evolutionarily and developmentally, from the exploitation of a widespread sensorimotor network, along a fundamental continuity between embodied and symbolic modes of experience. In this regard, the fine balancing between constrained sensorimotor connections (responsible for self-embodiment processing) and more untethered neural associations (responsible for abstract and symbolic processing) is context dependent and plastically neuromodulated, thus intersubjectively constructed within a specific socio-cultural milieu. Instead, in the schizophrenia spectrum this system falls off catastrophically, due to an unbalance toward too unconstrained sensorimotor connectivity, leading to a profound distortion of self/world relation with a symbolic activity detached from its embodied ground. For this very reason, however, schizophrenia psychopathology may contribute to unveil, in a distorted or magnified way, ubiquitous structural features of human symbolic activity, beneath the various, historically determined cultural systems. In this respect, a comparative approach, linking psychopathology and ethnoarchaeology, allows highlight the following invariant formal characteristics of symbolic processing: (1) Emergence of salient perceptive fragments, which stand out from the perceptual field. (2) Spreading of a multiplicity of new significances with suspension of common-sense meaning. (3) Dynamic and passive character through which meaning proliferation is experienced. This study emphasizes the importance of fine-grained psychopathology to elucidate, within a cross-disciplinary framework, the evolutionarily and developmental pathways that shape the basic structures of human symbolization.",Neuroscience,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11013-024-09873-5,0

"ObjectiveMany psychiatry residency programs are actively incorporating neuroscience training into their curricula; however, relatively little scholarship exploring neuroscience and psychiatry integration in undergraduate medical education has been conducted. This study investigated second-year, pre-clerkship medical students’ perceptions on the relationship between neuroscience and psychiatry following foundational neuroscience and behavior instruction to identify their views before they enter clerkships.MethodsA mixed methods design combined qualitative analysis of medical students’ essays in response to the prompt: “What is the relationship between neuroscience and psychiatry?” with quantitative analysis of survey responses on a 7-point scale.ResultsNinety-three percent of the class participated in the study (n= 77). Learners rated neuroscience as important for understanding and treating psychiatric disorders, albeit less important for psychiatric compared to neurological disorders. Using applied thematic analysis, the authors identified qualitative themes. Specifically, participants recognized neuroscience as a foundational science for psychiatry, but some emphasized that factors other than neuroscience are needed to explain psychiatric disorders. Some students perceived neuroscience and psychiatry as complementary approaches to understanding the brain and behavior. Others identified a role for neuroscience in reducing the stigma of psychiatric disorders and thereby improving access to psychiatric care.ConclusionsThe quantitative and qualitative findings reinforced each other and provided novel insight to pre-clerkship medical students’ views on the relevance of neuroscience for psychiatry. Educating all medical students, not just psychiatry residents, on the neuroscience of psychiatric disorders may better equip the next generation of physicians, regardless of specialty, to care for their patients with psychiatric conditions.",Neuroscience,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40596-021-01525-9,0
"Neurological evidence is increasingly used in criminal cases to argue that a defendant is less responsible for their behaviour, is not competent to stand trial or should receive a reduced punishment for the crime. Unfortunately, neurologists are rarely involved in such cases despite having the expertise to help to inform these decisions in court. In this Perspective, we advocate for the development of ‘forensic neurology’, a subspecialty of neurology focused on using neurological clinical and scientific expertise to address legal questions for the criminal justice system. We review literature suggesting that the incidence of criminal behaviour is higher in people with certain neurological disorders than the general public and that undiagnosed neurological abnormalities are common in people who commit crimes. We discuss the need for forensic neurologists in criminal cases to provide an opinion on what neurological diagnoses are present, the resulting symptoms and ultimately whether the symptoms affect legal determinations such as criminal responsibility or competency.",Neuroscience,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1038/s41582-023-00920-0,0

"This study has been proposed to improve the holistic evaluation in the FITradeoff decision-making process. The study generates recommendations that can support the analyst during the advising process with the decision-maker. A neuroscience tool is applied to conduct a behavioral study. Using an electroencephalogram, the Alpha and Theta activities have been monitored from a sample of twenty-seven management engineering students. The neuroscience experiment is composed of graphical and tabular visualizations. These visualizations represent multi-criteria decision problems, and they are presented in the holistic evaluation phase of the FITradeoff method. As result, the Alpha-Theta Diagram has been obtained, based on frontal Theta and parietal Alpha activities. The Alpha-Theta Diagram is a tool proposed to be applied during the holistic evaluation phase, with the visualizations. Thus, based on the Alpha-Theta Diagram, the visualizations in which the decision-maker presents the adequate pattern of behavioral, with high cognitive effort and high engagement are revealed. Statistical tests show that in most of the visualizations there have been significant cognitive effort and/or engagement of participants. Thus, based on this diagram, recommendations can consider the visualizations that use the adequate patterns of behavioral. As conclusion, the result reinforces which visualization should be used for holistic evaluation during the FITradeoff decision process. For future studies, rigorous investigations should be performed with EEG responses, specially to develop the Alpha-Theta Diagram for participants.",Neuroscience,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10479-021-04495-1,0

"By the late 1990s, several converging trends in economics, psychology, and neuroscience had set the stage for the birth of a new scientific field known as “neuroeconomics”. Without the availability of an extensive variety of experimental designs for dealing with individual and social decision-making provided by experimental economics and psychology, many neuroeconomics studies could not have been developed. At the same time, without the significant progress made in neuroscience for grasping and understanding brain functioning, neuroeconomics would have never seen the light of day. The paper is an overview of the main significant advances in the knowledge of brain functioning by neuroscience that have contributed to the emergence of neuroeconomics and its rise over the past two decades. These advances are grouped over three non-independent topics referred to as the “emo-rational” brain, “social” brain, and “computational” brain. For each topic, it emphasizes findings considered as critical to the birth and development of neuroeconomics while highlighting some of prominent questions about which knowledge should be improved by future research. In parallel, it shows that the boundaries between neuroeconomics and several recent sub-fields of cognitive neuroscience, such as affective, social, and more generally, decision neuroscience, are rather porous.",Neuroscience,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11238-021-09830-3,0

"Despite an enormous quantity of data, contemporary neuroscience does not provide satisfactory explanations for the nature of mind or consciousness. Today the main searches for answers to these questions focus around the problem of the neural bases of consciousness. This article analyzes the most important characteristics of consciousness and the requirements to be met by any fundamental scientific theory explaining it. These criteria are used to critique the most widely discussed neuroscience theories of consciousness. Among them are some satisfying some of the key requirements, though none meets all. I propose that a neuroscientific understanding of consciousness requires us to start thinking of the brain not as a connectome, i.e., a neural network, but as a neural hypernetwork consisting of neuronal groups with specific cognitive properties. The structure of the cognitome is the same as the structure of mind, while consciousness is a specific process of large-scale integration of cognitive elements in this neural hypernetwork.",Neuroscience,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11055-021-01149-4,0

"BackgroundNext-generation sequencing (NGS) is well established in clinical diagnostics, and whole-genome sequencing (WGS) is increasingly becoming the method of choice, as a result of lower prices and robust comprehensive data. While guidelines exist for variant interpretation and laboratory quality considerations, there remains a need for standardised bioinformatics practices to ensure clinical consensus, accuracy, reproducibility and comparability.MethodsThis article presents consensus recommendations developed by 13 clinical bioinformatics units participating in the Nordic Alliance for Clinical Genomics (NACG) by expert bioinformaticians working in clinical production. The recommendations are based on clinical practice and focus on analysis types, test and validation, standardisation and accreditation, as well as core competencies and technical management required for clinical bioinformatics operations.ResultsKey recommendations include adopting the hg38 genome build as reference, and a standard set of recommended analyses, including the use of multiple tools for structural variant (SV) calling and in-house data sets for filtering recurrent calls. Clinical bioinformatics in production should operate at standards similar to ISO 15189, utilising off-grid clinical-grade high-performance computing systems, standardised file formats and strict version control. Reproducibility should be ensured through containerised software environments. Pipelines must be documented and tested for accuracy and reproducibility, minimally covering unit, integration and end-to-end testing. Standard truth sets such as GIAB and SEQC2 for germline and somatic variant calling, respectively, should be supplemented by recall testing of real human samples that have been previously tested using a validated method. Data integrity must be verified using file hashing, while sample identity must be confirmed through fingerprinting and genetically inferred identification markers such as sex and relatedness. Finally, clinical bioinformatics should encompass diverse skills, including software development, data management, quality assurance and domain expertise in human genetics.ConclusionsThese recommendations provide a consensus framework for standardising bioinformatics practices across clinical WGS applications and can serve as a practical guide to facilities that are new to large-scale sequencing-based diagnostics, or as a reference for those who already run high-volume clinical production using NGS.",Bioinformatics,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s13073-025-01543-4,1

"The biosynthesis of nanoparticles (NPs), using microbial extracellular metabolites, represents an eco-friendly alternative to conventional physical and chemical methods for NP synthesis. Microorganisms release diverse metabolites, including redox-active compounds, extracellular polymeric substances (EPS), and biosurfactants, which facilitate the reduction and stabilization of NPs. Recent advancements in bioinformatics have transformed microbial NP synthesis by enabling metabolic pathway analysis, molecular docking, and genome mining. This review highlights the bioinformatics-driven role of microbial extracellular metabolites in NP synthesis and stabilization. Computational tools such as machine learning models, PRISM, and antiSMASH were employed for docking studies between metabolites and metal ion precursors to elucidate the mechanisms of NP synthesis. Molecular docking results revealed that key extracellular metabolites such as NADH reductase, surfactin, curdlan synthase, and pullulanase effectively interact with metal ion precursors such as silver, zinc, and iron ions, subsequently reducing them into respective NPs and stabilizing them. Furthermore, SwissADME-based bioinformatics analysis assessed hydrophilicity, lipophilicity, and hydrogen bonding potential, confirming NADH as a potent reducing agent, while surfactin and pullulanase functioned as capping and stabilizing agents. The study also discusses the effects of parameters such as pH, temperature, and reactant concentration on the NP synthesis and stabilization process, along with the advanced applications of such NPs. However, limitations related to scalability, insufficient characterization techniques, and variability in microbial metabolite production hinder their widespread application. Future research should focus on integrating synthetic biology, bioinformatics, and nanotechnology to improve the efficiency of nanoparticle biosynthesis.",Bioinformatics,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12668-025-01928-0,1
"BackgroundBronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a prevalent respiratory disease in premature infants and is accompanied by impaired lung function, increased infection risk, and other long-term complications. This study aimed to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of BPD, especially mitophagy.MethodsBioinformatics analyses were performed to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in BPD. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was used to explore gene modules associated with mitophagy, functional enrichment analyses to identify key biological processes, and immune infiltration to assess immune cell differences.ResultsAmong the 720 DEGs identified, 419 were upregulated and 301 were downregulated: these may serve as potential BPD biomarkers. WGCNA revealed that the turquoise module was strongly related to mitophagy (r= −0.6061,p< 0.05), indicating its significance in BPD pathogenesis. Enrichment analyses highlighted leukocyte migration and neutrophil extracellular trap formation, suggesting immune-mediated inflammatory response. Eight hub genes (S100P, CDC42EP3, CEACAM3, CKLF, RGL4, DOK3, B4GALT5, and MCEMP1) were identified as potential therapeutic targets. Immune infiltration analysis revealed significant differences in neutrophils and activated CD8+T cells, underscoring the immune system’s role in BPD.ConclusionKey molecular players and pathways involved in BPD were elucidated, providing insights for future targeted therapies addressing immunity and mitophagy in BPD.ImpactThis study identifiesCEACAM3andCDC42EP3as key genes involved in mitophagy and immune dysregulation in bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD).It provides novel insights into the TNF-α/NF-κB signaling pathway and its role in the pathogenesis of BPD.This study advances biomarker discovery by associatingCEACAM3with neutrophil infiltration andCDC42EP3with CD8+ T cell activity.The selected machine learning and bioinformatics approaches enhance the diagnostic accuracy and therapeutic targeting of BPD.These findings lay the foundation for future translational research in guiding personalized interventions for high-risk neonates.",Bioinformatics,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1038/s41390-025-04319-z,1

"PurposeThis study investigated the involvement of disulfidptosis in the pathophysiology of sepsis by applying a bioinformatics analysis assisted by large language models (LLMs).MethodsBased on DeepSeek R1 and retrieval-augmented generation technology, a deep retrieval architecture was developed for extracting disulfidptosis-related genes. An intersection of genes from LLM extraction, manual extraction, and datasets was included for bioinformatics analyses. Using DeepSeek R1, we synthesized a multi-step bioinformatics protocol from prior publications. The analyses were then performed according to the protocol. Key gene candidates were identified using multiple machine learning models, and validation was performed in a cecal ligation and puncture mouse model of sepsis.ResultsA total of 21 disulfidptosis-related genes were included for bioinformatics analyses. Nine bioinformatics techniques were integrated based on the LLM summarization of two key references. Thirteen disulfidptosis-related differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified in sepsis. Based on these DEGs, sepsis patients were classified into two molecular subgroups with distinct immune profiles. Among the machine learning models evaluated, the support vector machine achieved the highest classification performance (AUC = 0.989). Five hub genes—FSTL1,SELP,PPBP,ITGA2B, andPF4—were selected as key biomarkers. Experimental validation confirmed significantly elevated expression of these genes in the sepsis mice compared with their sham counterparts.ConclusionOur study assisted bioinformatics analysis with large language models and revealed a critical role for disulfidptosis in sepsis.

"AbstractBioinformatics has the potential to provide new insights into the pathogenic mechanisms of complex childhood-onset diseases. Otoferlin is one example. There has been an upsurge in utilization of bioinformatics techniques to analyze large data sets in systemic lupus and other diseases. While this can result in large numbers of innovative new biomarkers, diagnostics, and targeted therapies, readers should be mindful of the limitations of bioinformatic analyses. In specific, limitations in the size and diversity of the cohorts or bio-specimens used to generate the original datasets may lead to bias. Moreover, the rigor of the data analysis plan is critical to reproducibility of the findings. Systemic lupus erythematous is an extremely heterogeneous syndrome. There are five classes of lupus nephritis and several other non-classifiable histologic forms of lupus kidney disease. There are at least 23 distinct cell types that comprise the kidney parenchyma, and dozens of other types of infiltrating bone-marrow derived cells. In pediatric research, interpretation of bioinformatics data requires an appreciation for age and developmental effects on anatomy and physiology. With informed methodologies, the repurposing of large data sets from pediatric patients for meta-analyses can advance our understanding of childhood illnesses like lupus nephritis.ImpactIntegrative bioinformatics is a powerful approach to repurpose large data sets for discovery research.The manuscript by Wu et al. in Pediatric Research identifies otoferlin (OTOF) as a promising new diagnostic biomarker of childhood-onset lupus nephritis.Pediatric researchers should gain more appreciation for the available algorithms for analyzing large data sets from multi-omic projects and funding should be targeted for validating findings in childhood-onset diseases.",Bioinformatics,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1038/s41390-025-04314-4,1

"Prominin-1, or CD133, is a membrane-bound pentaspan protein that has been utilized recently to identify cancer stem cells (CSCs) in a variety of carcinomas. Today, bioinformatics offers a potent tool for studying the structural and functional relationships of fusion proteins. A structure–activity relationship model based on physicochemical characteristics, biological functions of single-chain antibodies, and molecular conformation can be developed by the integration of biomolecular computer models with biological experiments. In the present study, a mice library of single-chain variable fragment (scFv) antibodies was developed by mRNA extracted from mice immunized for the efficient and specific identification of the N-terminal domain of recombinant CD133 (D-EC1). First, a part of sequences of the scFvs library were cloned in the T.vector and sequenced. Then, bioinformatics was used to select the scFvs with high affinity by molecular dynamics simulations and docking. Based on bioinformatics analysis, three scFvs were cloned and expressed. Finally, the ability of the selected scFv was confirmed with the indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and immunocytochemistry (ICC). ELISA data showed that scFv3 had a greater affinity for the N-terminal of recombinant CD133, and it was selected for the immunocytochemistry (ICC) analysis. The immunocytochemistry experiments confirmed that the obtained scFv could bind to the CD133-expressing HT-29 cells. Our results suggest that using bioinformatics tools could be applied as a new, rapid, and valid method for the design and development of antibodies with improved properties. The selected scFv may be successfully applied in scFv-based diagnostics and therapeutics.Graphical Abstract",Bioinformatics,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00210-025-03894-6,1

"BackgroundSarcoma is a rare and heterogeneous group of malignant tumors originating from mesenchymal tissues, which presents significant challenges for diagnosis and treatment. Ferroptosis, a newly recognized form of iron-dependent cell death, is distinct from other cell death mechanisms such as apoptosis and autophagy. Recent studies have shown that the induction of ferroptosis is an effective way to kill sarcoma cells and reduce their resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs, highlighting the importance of understanding how ferroptosis may influence the biology and treatment of sarcomas.MethodsIn this study, we employed three main methods, namely CiteSpace, VOSviewer, and the R package “bibliometrix”, to analyze relevant literature. Publications related to ferroptosis and sarcoma in the Science Citation Index Expanded of the Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC) database (2012–2023) were included, and bioinformatics analyses were performed using R Studio and public databases.ResultsThe analysis revealed that research on sarcomas and ferroptosis has experienced a steady increase over the years, with a diverse range of research topics and collaborations established among researchers worldwide. The key findings include the identification of influential authors and institutions, prominent research clusters, and emerging research trends. The bioinformatics analysis results confirmed the significance of ferroptosis-related gene ACSF2 in different sarcomas. Notably, the scarcity of studies focusing on the relationship between sarcoma and ferroptosis has been observed, highlighting the potential for further exploration in this area.ConclusionThe integration of bibliometrics and bioinformatics provides valuable insights into the research landscape of sarcoma and ferroptosis. Future research on ferroptosis will continue to focus on its mechanisms in sarcomas including immune microenvironment, while also further exploring its potential clinical applications. We have identified a potential ferroptosis-related gene, ACSF2, which shows associations with survival in sarcoma datasets.

"BackgroundAntimicrobial resistance (AMR) poses a significant threat to global health, particularly in Western sub-Saharan Africa where 27.3 deaths per 100,000 lives are affected, and surveillance and control measures are often limited. Genomics research plays a crucial role in understanding the emergence, spread and containment measures of AMR. However, its implementation in such settings is particularly challenging due to limited human capacity. This manuscript outlines a three-day bioinformatics workshop in Cameroon, highlighting efforts to build human capacity for genomics research to support AMR surveillance using readily accessible and user-friendly web-based tools. The workshop introduced participants to basic next-generation sequencing concepts, data file formats used in bacterial genomics, data sharing procedures and considerations, as well as the use of web-based bioinformatics software to analyse genomic data, including in silico prediction of AMR, phylogenetics analyses, and a quick introduction to Linux© command line.ResultsBriefly, a substantial increase in participants’ confidence in bioinformatics knowledge and skills was observed before and after the workshop. Notably, before the workshop most participants lacked confidence in their ability to identify next-generation sequencing technologies or workflows (64%) and analyse genetic data using web-based bioinformatics tools (81%). After the workshop, majority of participants were extremely confident using NCBI BLAST and other web-based bioinformatics tools for data analysis with a score ≥ 5 among which 45%, 9% and 18% had a score of 8, 9, and 10, respectively.ConclusionOur findings highlight the effectiveness of this training approach in empowering local researchers and bridging the bioinformatics gap in genomics surveillance of AMR in resource-constrained settings. We provide a detailed description of the relevant training approaches used, including workshop structure, the selection and planning, and utilization of freely available web-based tools, and the evaluation methods employed.

"The world is changing due to factors like bioterrorism, massive environmental changes, globalization of trade and commerce, growing urbanization, changing climate, and pollution. Numerous diseases have emerged because of these factors, especially in companion and food-producing animals. Numerous pathogens have established themselves in naïve populations, harming reproduction, productivity, and health. Bioinformatics is considered a valuable tool in infectious disease research, as it provides a comprehensive overview of the identification of pathogens, their genetic makeup, and their evolutionary relationship. Therefore, there is an urgent need for a novel bioinformatics approach to help decipher and model viral epidemiology and informatics on domestic animals and livestock.

"Compared to traditional intermediate concepts, specific bioinformatics entities are more informative and higher directional. This study is based on the BITOLA system and combines bioinformatics methods to determine the intermediate concept which is key to improve efficiency of Literature-based Knowledge Discovery, proposes the concept of “Swanson framework + Bioinformatics”, and conducts practice of Literature-based Knowledge Discovery to improve the scientificity and efficiency of research and development. Firstly, detected the disease related genes (i.e. differentially expressed genes) according to the results of gene functional analysis as intermediate concepts to carry out Literature-based Knowledge Discovery. Taking the disease “Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)” as an example, the potential “disease-drug” association was predicted, and the predicted drugs were verified from the perspective of bioinformatics. Two drugs potentially associated with ASD were found: Fish oil and Forskolin, which were closely related to ASD in bioinformatics analysis results and literature verification. The two “disease-drug” association results showed better scientificity. The BIOINF-ABC+model improves the accuracy of calculations by 76% compared to using the BITOLA system alone.

"Cancer remains one of the most deadly diseases in the world, requiring constant growth and improvements in therapeutic strategies. Traditional cancer treatments, such as chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and surgery, have limitations like off-target release, toxicity, and inefficient drug delivery. This study explains the role of bioinformatics and AI in optimizing and analyzing liposomal formulations for innovative and better cancer therapy. Molecular docking (MD), molecular dynamics simulations, and machine learning models are the computational techniques that can help to design stable liposomal carriers for drugs, predict receptor-ligand interactions, and can improve drug release efficiency. Improved liposome nanoparticles (LNPs) surface functionalization, the discovery of tumor-specific biomarkers, and the improvement of receptor-ligand interactions for accurate drug targeting are all made possible by bioinformatics tools and methodologies. Moreover, AI-assisted predictions and in silico modeling can speed up drug discovery and processing while eliminating the experimental expenditures and time. In the present review, we conducted MD studies to complement the discussed literature. MD was performed between cyclic RGD peptides (liposomal ligands) and the GPR116 receptor in triple-negative breast cancer, and between folic acid (liposomal ligand) and the Axl tyrosine kinase receptor for lung cancer, revealing strong and stable interactions and highlighting the amino acid residues involved. Notwithstanding current obstacles, computational tools have shown notable progress in nanomedicine, exploring more options for more individualized and effective cancer therapies. The combination of AI, machine learning, and multi-omics techniques to improve therapeutic efficacy and reduce side effects is a substantial key to the future of LNP-based cancer treatment.Graphical Abstract",Bioinformatics,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00604-025-07286-8,1
"BackgroundMetabolomics, the systematic analysis of small molecules in a given biological system, emerged as a powerful tool for different research questions. Newer, better, and faster methods have increased the coverage of metabolites that can be detected and identified in a shorter amount of time, generating highly dense datasets. While technology for metabolomics is still advancing, another rapidly growing field is metabolomics data analysis including metabolite identification. Within the next years, there will be a high demand for bioinformaticians and data scientists capable of analyzing metabolomics data as well as chemists capable of using in-silico tools for metabolite identification. However, metabolomics is often not included in bioinformatics curricula, nor does analytical chemistry address the challenges associated with advanced in-silico tools.Aim of reviewIn this educational review, we briefly summarize some key concepts and pitfalls we have encountered in a collaboration between a bioinformatician (originally not trained for metabolomics) and an analytical chemist. We identified that many misunderstandings arise from differences in knowledge about metabolite annotation and identification, and the proper use of bioinformatics approaches for these tasks. We hope that this article helps other bioinformaticians (as well as other scientists) entering the field of metabolomics bioinformatics, especially for metabolite identification, to quickly learn the necessary concepts for a successful collaboration with analytical chemists.Key scientific concepts of reviewWe summarize important concepts related to LC-MS/MS based non-targeted metabolomics and compare them with other data types bioinformaticians are potentially familiar with. Drawing these parallels will help foster the learning of key aspects of metabolomics.",Bioinformatics,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11306-024-02167-2,1
"Ferroptosis is increasingly implicated as a critical pathogenic mechanism in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). This study employed integrated bioinformatics approaches to identify key ferroptosis-related genes (FRGs), dysregulated signaling pathways, and immune infiltration patterns in pediatric Crohn’s disease (PCD). Gene expression profiles from the GSE117993 dataset (92 PCD patients, 55 healthy controls) were analyzed to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs). FRGs were curated from the FerrDb database. Intersection analysis revealed FRGs-DEGs, which underwent functional enrichment analysis. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis using CytoHubba identified hub genes. Immune cell infiltration was assessed via single-sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA). The diagnostic potential of hub genes was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis in two independent validation cohorts (GSE126124, GSE62207). Bioinformatics analysis identified 1,074 DEGs, including 21 FRGs-DEGs. Enrichment analysis implicated these FRGs-DEGs in metabolic regulation and IL-17 signaling pathway. PPI analysis identified five hub genes: PTGS2, IFNG, IL1B, IDO1, and NOS2. ssGSEA revealed significant accumulation of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and neutrophils in PCD. Validation results confirmed that all hub genes were significantly differentially expressed (p< 0.01), with IL1B exhibiting the best diagnostic performance.

"Abstract—Next-generation sequencing methods allow for full identification of the qualitative composition of microbiota in fermented foods, such as yogurts and kefirs. However, the use high-throughput sequencing for food composition analysis necessitates finding out the optimal combination of bioinformatics software and the database. The goal of our study is to determine the microbiota composition of fermented dairy products using high-throughput sequencing and to analyze how the choice of software affects the data obtained. We sequenced seven samples of fermented dairy product metagenomes to compare the composition and identify the main components. Reads obtained from sequencing the 16S rRNA gene segment of seven fermented dairy samples were analyzed using BLASTN against the NCBI 16S Microbial database, as well as MEGAN and MG-RAST. The analysis was likewise performed of a mix of generated pseudoreads composed ofLactococcus lactis,Levilactobacillus brevis,Lactobacillus kefiri, andLeuconostoc mesenteroides. The employed bioinformatics tools differ in their extant of applicability depending on the acceptable error level. BLASTN without binning allows for identification of samples to the species level, while MEGAN and MG-RAST allow for identification only to the genus level; but, at the same time, it is more prone to false positive errors with the use of various databases with incorrectly identified reference sequences. Thus, further identification of the bacterial composition of fermented dairy products requires the creation of curated database for correct identification up to the species level.",Bioinformatics,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1134/S2079086425600547,1
"The unsuccessful translation of cardiac regeneration and cardioprotection from animal experiments to clinical applications in humans has raised the question of whether microRNA bioinformatics can narrow the gap between animal and human research outputs. We reviewed the literature for the period between 2000 and 2024 and found 178 microRNAs involved in cardioprotection and cardiac regeneration. On analyzing the orthologs and annotations, as well as downstream regulation, we observed species-specific differences in the diverse regulation of the microRNAs and related genes and transcriptomes, the influence of the experimental setting on the microRNA-guided biological responses, and database-specific bioinformatics results. We concluded that, in addition to reducing the number of in vivo experiments, following the 3R animal experiment rules, the bioinformatics approach allows the prediction of several currently unknown interactions between pathways, coding and non-coding genes, proteins, and downstream regulatory elements. However, a comprehensive analysis of the miRNA-mRNA-protein networks needs a profound bioinformatics and mathematical education and training to appropriately design an experimental study, select the right bioinformatics tool with programming language skills and understand and display the bioinformatics output of the results to translate the research data into clinical practice.

"Diabetes nephropathy (DN) is a prevalent and severe microvascular diabetic complication. Despite the recent developments in germacrone-based therapies for DN, the underlying mechanisms of germacrone in DN remain poorly understood. This study used comprehensive bioinformatics analysis to identify critical microRNAs (miRNAs) and the potential underlying pathways related to germacrone activities. Additionally, we established a DN mice model, which was treated with germacrone, to investigate how it altered the miRNA transcriptome in mice kidneys. RNA sequencing was also performed on the DN mice model with and without germacrone pre-treatment. Based on our results, we found 23 miRNAs were differentially expressed in the DN group compared to the controls, and a total of 14 miRNAs were differentially expressed between the DN group and the germacrone-treated group. In addition, we identified three miRNAs (mmu-miR-542-5p, mmu-miR-149-5p and mmu-miR-196a-2-3p) that were upregulated with the DN group and downregulated in the germacrone-treated group. Bioinformatics analysis suggested that autophagy and apoptosis were related to the pathogenesis of DN and germacrone treatment.

"Laparoscopy is the gold standard for diagnosing endometriosis; however, it is an invasive and costly method. Recent studies offer a non-invasive approach based on extracellular vesicle miRNA. Despite this, no consensus diagnostic biomarker has been identified to date. For addressing this gap, we decided to investigate plasma derived extracellular vesicle associated candidate miRNAs. In order to identify candidate miRNAs, a comprehensive search was performed in PubMed database using the search terms “micro-RNA” and “endometriosis”. Then, bioinformatics analysis was performed utilizing the miRTarBase database, Enrichr, and relevant software. During the experimental phase, the presence of candidate miRNAs was assessed in blood samples of 13 women with severe endometriosis, confirmed through laparoscopy or doppler sonography, as well as in 11 endometriosis-free women, as control group. After literature review of 405 articles published between 2007 and 2023, followed by bioinformatics analysis, were identified five miRNAs (miR-451a, 148a, 23b, 100, and 154) as candidate miRNAs.

"BackgroundTranscription factor 19 (TCF19) is an important member of the transcription factor family, but its role in cancer is not well understood. This study aims to clarify the function of TCF19 and explore its mechanisms across various cancers, with a specific focus on breast cancer, using bioinformatics analysis and histological validation.MethodsGene expression profiles and clinical data were obtained from sources like The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), and Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) for bioinformatics analysis. Tumor–immune interactions were studied using the TISIDB database for immune-related insights. To confirm these findings, TCF19 expression was measured using quantitative RT-PCR, immunohistochemistry (IHC), and western blot assays. Additional validation was done with various experimental techniques, including CCK-8, colony-forming, transwell, and cell line-derived xenograft assays.ResultsTCF19 is significantly upregulated in many cancerous tissues, including breast cancer, as confirmed across multiple datasets and clinical samples. Higher TCF19 levels were associated with a poorer prognosis. Experimentally reducing TCF19 expression in MCF-7 cells impaired key cellular functions such as proliferation, invasion, migration, and tumor formation. Pathway enrichment analysis of TCGA samples revealed a strong link between TCF19 and the PLK1 pathway, a finding further supported by western blot results showing PLK1 downregulation following TCF19 silencing.ConclusionsHigh TCF19 expression is closely linked to poorer outcomes, especially in breast cancer. These findings highlight TCF19 as a promising biomarker with broad potential applications in cancer diagnosis and prognosis.",Bioinformatics,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12672-025-02546-8,1
"The exponential growth of genomic data from next-generation sequencing technologies has created an urgent need for advanced computational approaches that can efficiently process, integrate, and interpret complex multi-dimensional biological information. This comprehensive review examines how artificial intelligence (AI), particularly machine learning and deep learning, is transforming genomic data analysis and addressing critical limitations of traditional bioinformatics methods. A thorough literature search was conducted across PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar databases, targeting peer-reviewed studies published between 2010 and 2024. This review addresses a critical knowledge gap by synthesizing current AI applications across the genomic analysis pipeline, from variant calling to multi-omics integration and personalized medicine, whilst critically evaluating emerging technologies including explainable AI and federated learning. AI methods have significantly improved accuracy in variant calling, gene expression profiling, and disease risk prediction. Key findings demonstrate that deep learning models achieve superior performance in complex pattern recognition, whilst explainable AI addresses the ""black box"" problem essential for clinical adoption. Federated learning enables privacy-preserving collaborative research across institutions. However, significant challenges remain, including data standardization, computational costs, algorithm interpretability, and ethical considerations surrounding privacy and algorithmic bias. Future directions include quantum computing integration and AI-enhanced CRISPR technologies. This review concludes that whilst AI represents a transformative force in genomic research, successful clinical translation requires addressing current technical and ethical challenges through interdisciplinary collaboration, robust validation frameworks, and responsible implementation strategies prioritizing patient safety and data security.",Bioinformatics,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00438-025-02314-x,1

"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory disease that is frequently accompanied by depression, suggesting shared inflammatory pathways. This study investigatedDesmodium gangeticum(Shalaparni), an Ayurvedic herb containing the anti-inflammatory compound Gangetin, as a potential dual-acting therapeutic agent for RA and depression. We employed an integrative bioinformatics approach to explore the potential of Gangetin, a phytoconstituent of Shalaparni, as a dual-acting therapy. Target genes for RA and depression were retrieved from the DisGeNet database, while predicted molecular targets of Shalaparni were identified using SwissTargetPrediction. BioVenn was then used to visualize and identify overlapping genes among the RA-associated, depression-associated, and Shalaparni-target gene sets. A protein–protein interaction network was constructed using STRING and analyzed using Cytoscape. Gene ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analyses were conducted using the DAVID tool. Molecular docking of Gangetin, a phytochemical in Shalaparni, was performed with the top identified proteins using CB Dock. We identified 34 differentially expressed genes shared among RA, depression, and Shalaparni. The PPI network revealed significant interactions with hub genes, such as EGFR, BCL2, GSK3β, PIK3CA, and AKT1. Docking studies showed that Gangetin had high binding affinities with AKT1 and PIK3CA, indicating its potential to target key inflammatory pathways involved in both RA and depression. Shalaparni, through its active compound Gangetin, demonstrated potential as a dual-acting therapeutic agent for RA and depression by targeting shared inflammatory pathways. Further experimental validation is required to explore its clinical application.",Bioinformatics,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13596-025-00842-w,1
"Many studies have suggested that autophagy may be involved in the development of asthma disease. However, the mechanisms involved have not been fully elucidated. We aimed to identify and validate potential autophagy-related genes in asthma through bioinformatics analysis and experimental verification. Autophagy-related differentially expressed genes were analyzed by protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis, subject operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis, construction of relevant microRNAs (miRNAs), transcription factors (TFs), and drug interaction networks and immune infiltration analysis. Finally, validation was performed by western blotting (WB) and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Five hub genes were identified by PPI network analysis and key module construction. These genes showed good diagnostic value for asthma. We also predicted 34 associated miRNAs and 8 associated TFs as well as 10 predictive drugs. The abundance of immune cells, such as memory B cells, naïve CD4 + T cells, follicular helper T cells and gamma delta T cells, was higher compared with the control group. WB and qRT-PCR results showed that the expression levels of TP53, SQSTM1/p62 and ATG5 in the asthma group and healthy control group were consistent with the bioinformatics analysis of the mRNA microarrays, and the dexamethasone (Dex) treatment group was able to inhibit autophagy of cells and affect the expression levels of TP53, SQSTM1/p62 and ATG5 in the lung tissue of asthmatic mice. The present study provides a new insight that autophagy dysregulation exists in asthma and may be involved in the etiology of asthma by participating in multiple pathways and biological functions. Autophagy-related genes in asthma may be valuable biomarkers for diagnosis and prognosis, and they may be developed as clinical therapeutic targets in the future.",Bioinformatics,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1038/s41598-025-08316-4,1
"Lyme disease (LD) presents significant diagnostic challenges due to the absence of a reliable screening method for initial detection. This study aimed to identify potential biomarkers using bioinformatics and machine learning algorithms, which may contribute to future biomarker-based research for Lyme disease diagnostics.

"ContextDrosophila suzukii(Matsumura, 1931) is a widespread agricultural pest responsible for significant damage to various soft-skinned fruit hosts. The revolutionary potential of bioinformatics in agriculture emerges from its ability to provide extensive information on pests, fungi, chemical resistance, implications of non-target species, and other critical aspects. This wealth of information allows researchers to engage in projects and applied research in diverse agricultural domains that face these challenges. In this context, bioinformatics tools play a fundamental role. The negative impact of pests on crops, resulting in substantial economic losses, has highlighted the importance of in silico methods.MethodsTo achieve this, we conducted a systematic search in scientific databases using as keywords “Drosophila suzukii,” “biopesticides,” “simulations computational,” and “in-silico.” After applying the filters of relevance and publication date, we organized the articles and prioritized those that directly addressed that matched the keywords and the use of bioinformatics tools. Additionally, we included studies focusing on in silico assays of biopesticides, such as molecular docking. Our review aimed to present a collection of recent literature on biopesticides againstDrosophila suzukii, emphasizing bioinformatics methods. Through this work, we strive to contribute to the literature of new perspectives on the development and efficiency of biopesticides, along with to advance research that may improve pest control strategies.ResultsIn the results of the systematic review, we found 2734 articles related to the selected keywords. Six of these articles directly addressDrosophila suzukiiand the use of bioinformatics tools in the search for alternatives in pest control. In the selected studies, we observed that two articles tend to focus on phylogenetic approaches, searching for gene sequences, amino acids, and constructing phylogenetic trees. The other three articles used molecular modeling and docking of receptors such as GABA and TRP with plant-derived and synthetic compounds to study intermolecular interactions. However, we identified gaps in these studies that could lead to further research in the biorational development of biopesticides using bioinformatics tools.Graphical abstract",Bioinformatics,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00894-024-06113-w,1
"Cystitis glandularis (CG) is a chronic hyperplastic disorder of the bladder, and the available clinical drug therapy is insufficient currently. Glycyrrhetinic acid (GA), a bioactive compound extracted from the roots ofGlycyrrhiza glabra, is found with beneficial actions, including anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative effects. We previously reported that GA relieves CG symptoms in animal model, implying the potential application of GA to treat CG. However, the action mechanisms of GA against CG remain unclear. In this study, we aimed to identify the pivotal targets and therapeutic effects of GA through integrated bioinformatics analysis and experimental validation. Integrated bioinformatics analysis screened eleven potential therapeutic targets for GA against CG, and seven pivotal targets were identified subsequently. Enrichment gene analysis revealed GA exhibiting biological activities against CG via regulating multiple pharmacological targets and molecular pathways associated with inflammatory reaction and oxidative stress. Molecular docking computation revealed potent affinity and interaction between GA and prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 (PTGS2) and mucin 1 (MUC1) proteins in CG. To validate biochemically, increased mRNA and protein expressions of PTGS2 and MUC1 were observed in human CG samples. Compared to CG mice, GA-treated CG mice exhibited reduced inflammatory cytokine contents and downregulated PTGS2 and MUC1 mRNA and protein levels. These integrated findings suggest the potential therapeutic effects of GA against CG via the regulation of targeting genes and pathways. However, further studies are necessary to perform and facilitate the clinical application of GA for treating CG.Graphical abstract",Bioinformatics,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11030-025-11105-w,1
"Osteoporosis (OP), characterized by reduced bone density and increased fracture risk. Current therapies have limitations due to side effects and variable efficacy, necessitating exploration of novel therapeutic targets and alternatives like Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM). The molecular mechanisms driving OP remain incompletely understood. This study utilized integrated bioinformatics approaches to identify potentially dysregulated genes in OP and explored in vitro effects of TCM compounds targeting top identified genes. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) associated with OP were identified by integrating bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing datasets. Potential therapeutic compounds targeting selected DEGs were screened from a TCM database using molecular docking to predict binding affinities. Based on highest binding scores, two compounds were selected for experimental validation. Their effects on chondrogenic differentiation, relevant to the known function of the identified target genes CHAD and COL2A1, were assessed in vitro using ATDC5 cells. Integrated bioinformatics analysis consistently identified CHAD and COL2A1 as significantly downregulated genes in OP datasets, and they were upregulated after teriparatide injection. Molecular docking predicted binding affinities of several TCM compounds to CHAD and COL2A1, with tetrandrine and wogonin showing the highest binding affinities. They were selected for chondrogenesis and qRT-PCR validation, and wogonin was experimentally demonstrated to have better chondrogenic differentiation effects in vitro. This study employed a multi-omics bioinformatics approach to identify CHAD as a potential hub gene of interest associated with osteoporosis. Preliminary in vitro experiments showed that wogonin modulates chondrogenic differentiation, a process related to CHAD’s function, suggesting potential avenues for further investigation into OP therapeutics.",Bioinformatics,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1038/s41598-025-05861-w,1
"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a highly lethal malignancy associated with poor prognosis due to late-stage diagnosis and high recurrence rates. The MEX3 family genes has been implicated in various cancers; however, their roles in HCC remain largely unexplored. This study aims to systematically analyze the expression patterns, prognostic significance, and immune-related functions of MEX3A, MEX3B, MEX3C, and MEX3D in HCC using comprehensive bioinformatics approaches. We conducted a multi-level bioinformatics analysis to investigate the expression, prognostic significance, clinicopathological correlations, genetic alterations, immune associations, and functional mechanisms of MEX3 family members in HCC. Transcriptomic data from TCGA and GEO databases, along with experimental validation via qRT-PCR and Western blotting, were used to assess expression profiles. Kaplan-Meier, ROC curve, and Cox regression analyses were employed for prognostic evaluation. Co-expression, enrichment, and immune infiltration analyses further elucidated the functional and immunological relevance of MEX3 family genes. A prognostic model based on co-expressed genes was constructed and validated using LASSO and time-dependent ROC analyses. MEX3A, MEX3B, MEX3C, and MEX3D were significantly upregulated in HCC tissues compared to normal liver tissues (P< 0.05). ROC curve analysis demonstrated high diagnostic accuracy, particularly for MEX3A (AUC = 0.915). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis indicated that elevated MEX3A and MEX3C expression was associated with poorer overall survival (OS) and disease-specific survival (DSS) (P< 0.05). Mutation analysis revealed that MEX3A exhibited the highest alteration frequency (11%), primarily through gene amplifications. Immune infiltration analysis demonstrated significant correlations between MEX3 expression and multiple immune cell populations, including regulatory T cells (Tregs), cytotoxic T cells, and macrophages. Moreover, MEX3B, MEX3C, and MEX3D expression correlated with key immune checkpoint genes, including PDCD1, CD274, and CTLA4. Functional enrichment analysis revealed that MEX3 co-expressed genes were significantly involved in RNA metabolism, immune response regulation, and oncogenic signaling pathways. A 17-gene MEX3 co-expression-based prognostic model stratified patients into high- and low-risk groups with significantly different survival outcomes (AUC = 0.791 at 1 year). This study highlights the oncogenic potential of MEX3 family members in HCC and their associations with immune regulation. The findings suggest that MEX3 family genes could serve as potential biomarkers for HCC prognosis and immunotherapy responsiveness. Further experimental validation is warranted to elucidate the mechanistic roles of MEX3 family genes in HCC progression and immune evasion.",Bioinformatics,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1038/s41598-025-02057-0,1

This study aimed to reveal the underlying mechanisms of HCSI against osteosarcoma by integrating metabolomics, network pharmacology and bioinformatics.MethodsMetabolomics was used to identify different metabolites and pathways. Network pharmacology was utilized to predict the potential targets of HCSI against osteosarcoma. Differentially expressed lncRNAs and miRNAs were screened and the corresponding lncRNAs-miRNAs-mRNAs network were constructed through the GEO database and miRcode database. Machine learning and immune infiltration analysis were performed on the key target obtained from the intersection of network pharmacology and bioinformatics. The binding affinity between active compounds of HCSI and potential targets was evaluated by molecular docking. The underlying mechanisms were further validated by RT-qPCR and immunoblotting.ResultsLipid metabolism pathways were obtained by non-target metabolomics enrichment. A total of 44 HCSI targets associated with osteosarcoma were collected by network pharmacology. Intersection of the mRNAs obtained from ceRNA network with the above 44 targets yielded eight common targets. The main target HMGCR were obtained by machine learning and RT-qPCR. The BCYRN1-miR-27a-3p-HMGCR axis was subsequently screened as the primary ceRNA regulatory network in HSCI against osteosarcoma. Molecular docking also showed an excellent affinity between the active compounds of HCSI and HMGCR. In vitro experiments demonstrated that HCSI down-regulated HMGCR, thereby reduced intracellular cholesterol levels, and ultimately promoting osteosarcoma cell apoptosis.ConclusionHCSI could inhibit osteosarcoma progression by regulating lipid metabolism through BCYRN1-miR-27a-3p-HMGCR axis, indicating that HCSI may provide insights for developing herbal medicine injection-based therapies for osteosarcoma.Graphical Abstract",Bioinformatics,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s13020-025-01179-x,1
"Kawasaki disease (KD), as a common pediatric inflammatory vasculitis, has an unclear pathogenesis. This study integrated bioinformatics and clinical data analysis to explore the characteristics of ferroptosis in KD. We used data from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database to identify ferroptosis-related genes, and variable selection was performed using Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) analysis. We employed seven machine learning methods to determine the optimal predictive model, revealing that the Support Vector Machine (SVM) model exhibited optimal performance in external validation. Unsupervised clustering based on FRGs stratified KD patients into high and low expression subtypes. The high expression subtype showed significantly elevated levels of monocyte immune infiltration, which was further validated by single-cell analysis. Clinical data analysis demonstrated that patients in the high-monocyte group not only had a higher incidence of incomplete KD presentations but also exhibited lower resistance to intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) therapy. These results suggest that ferroptosis may participate in the pathogenesis of KD by modulating monocyte levels, providing new insights into explaining clinical heterogeneity and differences in IVIG treatment responses.",Bioinformatics,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1038/s41598-025-15182-7,1
"BackgroundAcute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) remains a leading cause of mortality in intensive care units. The N6-methyladenosine (m6A) mRNA modification is critical in various pathological conditions, yet its role in the ARDS microenvironment, particularly at the single-cell level, remains poorly understood.MethodsSingle-cell and bulk RNA-sequencing datasets were sourced from the GEO databases.

"While dysregulated autophagy has been linked to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) development in sepsis, the exact regulatory mechanisms driving this process remain unclear. This study systematically investigated autophagy-related genes in sepsis-induced ARDS using integrative bioinformatics, including weighted gene coexpression network analysis (WGCNA), differential gene expression analysis (DEGs), receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis, protein‒protein interaction (PPI) network analysis, and immune infiltration analysis. Hub genes were further validated by qPCR in Beas-2B cells receiving lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation. We identified 18 autophagy-related DEGs with diagnostic potential for sepsis-induced ARDS. These DEGs were linked to endocytosis, protein kinase inhibition, and enigmatic Ficolin-1-rich granules. The downregulated hallmark signaling pathways involved apoptosis, complement, IL-2/STAT5, and KRAS signaling. Immune infiltration analysis revealed alterations in 7 immune cell subsets, including CD8 + T-cell exhaustion, natural killer cell reduction, and the type 1 helper T-cell response. When Beas-2B cells were treated with LPS, we discovered that 6 out of the 18 hub genes were significantly downregulated.

"Liver fibrosis (LF) is a medical disorder caused by prolonged chronic liver injury, which, if left untreated, can progress to cirrhosis or liver cancer, posing significant risks to patient health. In recent years, the increase in liver diseases, including alcoholic liver disease, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and viral hepatitis, has significantly heightened the prevalence of LF. SUMOylation, an important post-translational modification, is essential for regulating cellular functions and may play a critical role in the progression of LF; however, its exact mechanisms remain poorly understood. This study conducted a thorough examination of the expression patterns of SUMOylation-related genes in patients with LF for the first time. We obtained two LF datasets (GSE130970 and GSE84044) from the GEO database, integrated the data for DEG analysis and functional enrichment analysis, and employed machine learning techniques to identify pivotal genes. Furthermore, we utilized ssGSEA and immune cell infiltration analysis to evaluate the roles of these genes within the immunological context of LF. To validate the bioinformatics findings, we established a CCl₄-induced C57BL/6 mouse model of LF to investigate the expression of relevant genes. A total of 1,583 differentially expressed genes were identified, 13 of which were associated with SUMOylation. These genes were primarily enriched in biological processes related to cell signal transduction, cell adhesion, and inflammatory responses. Utilizing machine learning approaches, we found eight crucial genes (NR3C2, PCNA, THRB, CDKN2A, DNMT1, MDM2, SMC6, and RXRA) that have significant diagnostic potential in the progression of LF. Additionally, we observed a significant increase in the infiltration of several immune cell types, with evident correlations between the expression of SUMOylation-related genes and specific immune cell types. The results of the animal experiments validated the bioinformatics analysis, as key SUMOylation-related genes exhibited expression patterns consistent with our expectations in the CCl₄-induced LF mouse model. This study elucidates the critical roles of SUMOylation-related genes in LF, highlighting their influence on liver damage and the progression of fibrosis through the regulation of cytokine synthesis, facilitation of hepatic stellate cell activation, and enhancement of immune cell infiltration. The identified significant genes exhibit potential as novel biomarkers for therapeutic applications.

"Despite the growing recognition of microRNAs (miRNAs) as critical biomarkers in cancer, current approaches to their analysis remain fragmented, disjointed, and poorly integrated with emerging computational advances. This lack of cohesion limits progress toward reproducible and clinically actionable biomarker discovery. To address this unmet need, we present a review that unifies the latest findings and tools in bioinformatics, machine learning (ML), and large language models (LLMs) for miRNA analysis in oncology, thereby bridging a significant methodological gap in the field. We begin by critically synthesizing, benchmarking, and evaluating algorithms, including miRDeep2 and DIANA-miRPath, within a functional pipeline that spans next-generation sequencing (NGS) data processing to multi-omics integration. Building on this foundation, we review ML-augmented layers incorporating supervised and deep learning (DL) algorithms, specifically support vector machines (SVMs), convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and recurrent neural networks (RNNs), to enable robust miRNA signature identification, classification, and target prediction. Furthermore, we explore the integration of generative models and LLMs to support hypothesis generation and enhance reproducibility in biomarker discovery workflows. This comprehensive framework enhanced with artificial intelligence (AI) is contextualized through cancer-specific datasets, with particular emphasis on translational applications for early detection, prognosis, and therapy selection. By systematically organizing fragmented methodologies into a scalable and reproducible pipeline, our work provides a strategic roadmap to accelerate the development of miRNA-based precision cancer.",Bioinformatics,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13353-025-01024-9,1
"Magnesium is an essential macro-mineral that plays a vital role in cardiovascular health. The magnesium depletion score (MDS) has recently been proposed as a composite indicator to assess magnesium status. Although previous studies have linked higher MDS values to cardiovascular and all-cause mortality, evidence regarding its association with hypertension remains limited in large, representative populations. This study aimed to examine the relationship between MDS and hypertension risk and to explore potential molecular mechanisms through integrative bioinformatics analysis. We analyzed data from a large population-based cross-sectional survey. Multivariable logistic regression and restricted cubic spline (RCS) analyses were used to evaluate the association and dose–response relationship between MDS and hypertension. Mediation analysis was conducted to assess the indirect role of metabolic factors. Gene-based bioinformatics analyses, including Gene Ontology (GO), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), Reactome, and disease–gene association analyses, were performed to identify molecular pathways shared among magnesium, hypertension, and diabetes. Higher MDS levels were significantly and independently associated with an increased risk of hypertension across all models. ROC analysis showed that the combination of MDS with other clinical indicators exhibited strong predictive performance (AUC = 0.84). RCS analysis revealed a nonlinear association, with hypertension risk sharply increasing when MDS exceeded 1.59. Mediation analysis indicated that diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and metabolic syndrome did not mediate this relationship. Gene-based integrative analysis identified 1,193 overlapping genes shared between magnesium ion and hypertension, primarily involved in vascular regulation, oxidative stress response, endothelial signaling, and extracellular communication. These genes were significantly enriched in cAMP signaling, AGE–RAGE signaling in diabetic complications, HIF-1 signaling, platelet activation, integrin-mediated interactions, and GPCR-related pathways, suggesting that magnesium deficiency may influence hypertension through vascular remodeling, inflammation, and impaired nitric oxide signaling. Magnesium depletion is strongly associated with hypertension and may contribute to its pathogenesis through coordinated genetic and molecular pathways related to vascular tone, oxidative stress, and inflammatory signaling. Integrating population-based epidemiologic and bioinformatics analyses provides novel mechanistic insight into the link between magnesium status and hypertension.",Bioinformatics,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12011-025-04890-w,1

Taking advantage of the protein sequence ofGiardiafibrillarin, multiple bioinformatics tools were employed to estimate its domains, nuclear and nucleolar localization signals (NLS and NoLS), post-translational modifications, phylogeny, and three-dimensional structure. The analysis revealed significant conservation ofGiardiafibrillarin, showing close relationships with archaeal and parasitic amoeba orthologs. It retains essential features such as the SAM-dependent methyltransferase domain, a glycine- and arginine-rich domain, and both NLS and NoLS. While the core region of the protein is structurally conserved, the N-terminal region exhibits notable divergence. The potential for inhibition ofGiardiafibrillarin by SAM competitors suggests that it could be a promising target for drug development, particularly for strains resistant to current treatments.",Bioinformatics,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13353-024-00920-w,1
"BackgroundBreast cancer (BC) is one of the most prevalent malignancies among women worldwide, and early detection is crucial for improving patient outcomes. Among the key signaling pathways involved in BC, the MAPK signaling pathway plays a significant role in tumor progression.MethodsThrough bioinformatics analysis, we identified miRNAs associated with the MAPK signaling pathway. Differential expression analysis using microarray data from the GSE106817 and GSE113486 datasets further refined our selection. Based on these analyses, we identified two candidate miRNAs, hsa-miR-27a-5p and hsa-miR-449a, as potential biomarkers for BC. We then examined the expression levels of these two serum miRNAs in women with BC (n= 100) and healthy controls (n= 100) using RT-PCR.ResultsOur results demonstrated that both miRNAs were significantly upregulated in women with BC compared to healthy individuals (p< 0.05). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis further confirmed that these miRNAs exhibit strong diagnostic potential for BC.ConclusionOverall, our findings suggest that hsa-miR-27a-5p and hsa-miR-449a, identified through bioinformatics and microarray-based expression analyses, could serve as promising biomarkers for BC detection. Their significant association with the MAPK signaling pathway was determined through bioinformatics analysis.",Bioinformatics,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11033-025-10705-x,1
"Psoralea bituminosaL. (Fabaceae) is a medicinal plant traditionally used for its antimicrobial, antihyperglycemic, and antioxidant effects. This study investigated its anticancer and antioxidant potential using aqueous and methanol extracts. The methanol extract exhibited higher total phenol (81.57 mg/g) and total flavonoid (39.06 mg/g) contents compared to the aqueous extract. Antioxidant activity, assessed via the DPPH assay, showed moderate potency (IC₅₀: 330.77 µg/mL for aqueous- and 348.27 µg/mL for methanol extracts). Notably, the methanol extract demonstrated significant cytotoxicity against multiple cancer cell lines (IC₅₀: 27.73–53.90 µg/mL) particularly against A549, MDA-MB231, and PC3. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) profiling revealed abundant flavonoids and isoflavones such as daidzein, biochanin A, and 7,3’-dimethoxy-5,6,4’ trihydroxyisoflavone in the methanol extract, correlating with its anticancer effects. In contrast, glycosylated flavonoids in the aqueous extract aligned with antioxidant activity. Cheminformatics clustering supported these findings, identifying distinct structural groups with differing drug-likeness scores. Bioinformatics analysis further identified transcriptomic signatures enriched in oxidative phosphorylation and key cancer-related pathways (e.g., TP53, PI3K, NRF2, and MYC), offering mechanistic insight. This integrative approach combining LC-MS, cheminformatics, and bioinformatics provides a cost-effective framework for decoding phytochemical bioactivity and guiding natural product-based drug discovery.",Bioinformatics,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1038/s41598-025-04195-x,1
"Biomarkers associated with the progression from gastric intestinal metaplasia (GIM) to gastric adenocarcinoma (GA), i.e., GA-related GIM, could provide valuable insights into identifying patients with increased risk for GA. The aim of this study was to utilize multi-bioinformatics to reveal potential biomarkers for the GA-related GIM and predict potential drug repurposing for GA prevention in patients. The multi-bioinformatics included gene expression matrix (GEM) by microarray gene expression (MGE), ScType (a fully automated and ultra-fast cell-type identification based solely on a given scRNA-seq data), Ingenuity Pathway Analysis, PageRank centrality, GO and MSigDB enrichments, Cytoscape, Human Protein Atlas and molecular docking analysis in combination with immunohistochemistry. To identify GA-related GIM, paired surgical biopsies were collected from 16 GIM-GA patients who underwent gastrectomy, yielding 64 samples (4 biopsies per stomach x 16 patients) for MGE. Co-analysis was performed by including scRNAseq and immunohistochemistry datasets of endoscopic biopsies of 37 patients. The results of the present study showed potential biomarkers for GA-related GIM, including GEM of individual patients, individual genes (such as RBP2 and CD44), signaling pathways, network of molecules, and network of signaling pathways with key topological nodes.

"Inflammation is a defensive mechanism that safeguards the human body against detrimental stimuli. Within this intricate process, ADAM17, a zinc-dependent metalloprotease, emerges as an indispensable element, fostering the activation of diverse inflammatory and growth factors within the organism. Nonetheless, ADAM17 malfunctions can augment the rate of growth, inflammatory factors, and subsequent damage. Thus, in this study, we examined and repurposed drugs to suppress the activity of ADAM17. To this end, we employed bioinformatics techniques such as molecular docking, molecular dynamics, and pharmacokinetic studies. Five FDA-approved drugs including Raltegravir, Conivaptan, Paclitaxel, Saquinavir, and Venetoclax with the ability to impede the activity of the ADAM17 metalloenzyme were identified. Moreover, these drugs did not include strong zinc-binding functional groups when verified by the ACE functional group finder. However, furtherin silicoanalysis has indicated that Raltegravir demonstrates a commendable interaction with the active site amino acids and exhibits the most favorable pharmacokinetic properties compared to others. Considering the results of bioinformatics tools, it can be concluded that Raltegravir as an antiviral drug could be repurposed to prevent severe inflammatory response and tumorigenesis resulting from ADAM17 malfunction.",Bioinformatics,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1038/s41598-024-82065-8,1
"Tuberculosis, induced byMycobacterium tuberculosis(Mtb), continues to pose a significant global public health challenge. Ferroptosis has emerged as a pivotal factor in tuberculosis pathogenesis, however, the mechanism has not yet been fully clarified. Therefore, the aim of this study was to hypothesize and validate potential ferroptosis-related genes in Mtb infection through bioinformatics analysis, thereby offering insights for further investigation. The mRNA microarray expression profile datasets were sourced from the Gene Expression Omnibus. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were derived using GEO2R. Subsequently, the shared DEGs between the GSE174566 and GSE227851 datasets were intersected with the genes in the ferroptosis database. The ferroptosis-associated shared DEGs (Ferr-sDEGs) were validated in the GSE20050 dataset. They were subjected to PPI, Cytoscape and Friends analysis, the infiltration correlation of immune cells and qRT-PCR. A total of 11 Ferr-sDEGs were identified, and 9 genes were validated. These analyses revealed that the key Ferr-sDEGs contributed to ferroptosis during Mtb infection and these key Ferr-sDEGs were relatively independent, implying that ferroptosis may be triggered by various mechanisms. Concurrently, the infiltration and correlation analysis demonstrated that multiple types of immune cells could be activated by the key Ferr-sDEGs. Ultimately, qRT-PCR validated that the expression levels of key Ferr-sDEGs. In conclusion, ferroptosis serves a pivotal function in the pathogenesis of tuberculosis.

"BackgroundSepsis is a critical illness, and mitochondrial dysfunction is associated with its progression. However, the classification of mitochondrial-related differentially expressed genes (MitoDEGs) in sepsis and the immune infiltration characteristics have not been thoroughly investigated. This study aimed to explore the relevant content.MethodsGene expression data were obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), while mitochondrial-related genes were sourced from the MitoCarta3.0 database. We applied Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) to identify Sepsis-related MitoDEGs (Se-MitoDEGs), and utilized unsupervised clustering analysis to categorize sepsis samples into distinct clusters. Machine learning algorithms identified hub Se-MitoDEGs, and a validation set and a nomogram for sepsis diagnosis were established. The CIBERSORT algorithm was employed to investigate immune infiltration characteristics in sepsis and their association with hub Se-MitoDEGs. The expression levels of relevant genes were evaluated in peripheral blood samples from septic patients and normal controls through quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Associated transcription factors, miRNAs, and drugs were constructed into a diagram via NetworkAnalyst and Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD).Results15 Se-MitoDEGs exhibited differential expression between septic and normal samples. Immune infiltration analysis demonstrated significant increases in neutrophils, activated mast cells, and M0 macrophages among septic patients compared to control subjects. We categorized sepsis samples into two clusters; most hub genes in cluster 2 (C2) were highly expressed, exhibiting low immune infiltration and immune score. Some differences were observed in the pathways between the two clusters. By utilizing machine learning techniques and the validation set, MSRB2, TSPO, and BLOC1S1 were identified, and a nomogram of the three genes exhibited a substantial area under the curve (AUC) of 0.886, and the AUC for the validation set was recorded at 0.866, highlighting the robustness of our predictive model. Survival analysis found that low expression of TSPO and high expression of MSRB2 in peripheral blood were negatively correlated with the 28-day survival rate of septic patients. qRT-PCR validation indicated that the expression levels of these three hub genes are consistent with our bioinformatics analysis results. Associated small molecules, including Estradiol, pirinixic acid, and Valproic acid, are potential therapeutic drugs for sepsis.ConclusionBy integrating bioinformatics with machine learning models, we identified three mitochondrial and immune-related biomarkers (MSRB2, TSPO, and BLOC1S1) with diagnostic value for sepsis.

"ObjectiveThis study employs integrated bioinformatics analysis and in vitro cellular experiments to elucidate the role of Synaptotagmin-12 (SYT12) in the progression of gastric cancer.MethodsWe utilized databases and platforms such as Xiantao Academic Tools, UALCAN, Kaplan-Meier plotter analysis, and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) to extract datasets on SYT12 in gastric cancer. We analyzed the relationship between SYT12 expression and the clinicopathological features, prognosis, diagnosis, and immune infiltration of stomach adenocarcinoma (STAD) patients. Verification was conducted using samples from 31 gastric cancer patients. Additionally, in vitro cellular experiments were performed to determine the role and potential mechanisms of SYT12 in the malignant behavior of gastric cancer cells.ResultsComprehensive bioinformatics analysis indicated that SYT12 is highly expressed in most cancers and is associated with promoter DeoxyriboNucleic Acid (DNA) methylation levels. SYT12 expression correlated with clinicopathological features, immune cell infiltration, immune checkpoint gene expression, and poor prognosis in STAD patients.

"The field of computational bioinformatics and systems biology analysis is rapidly expanding due to advancements in bioinformatics tools. Bipolar disorder (BD) is a severe psychiatric condition affecting both adults and adolescents. In recent years, the risk of stroke has increased among individuals with BD. Background studies indicate that BD and stroke share numerous biochemical and genetic characteristics. Due to traditional endocrinological approaches, no collaborative research exists, and no treatment options have been established for BD and stroke patients. The aim of this study is to identify common molecular pathways and potential therapeutic targets in BD and stroke that could be utilized to predict disease progression. To achieve this, shared genes were identified to determine common pathways. Based on the biochemical, molecular, and genetic interactions among these shared genes, this study identifies the most significant hub genes. To further explore these interactions, analysis such as the protein–protein interaction (PPI) network, topological properties, enrichment analysis, co-expression network, gene regulatory network (GRN), and physical interaction network are conducted. The GO annotation indicates that most of the genes are linked to MAP kinase activity and tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily binding. The KEGG pathway analysis revealed that the predominant genes are associated with apoptosis and the IL-18 signaling pathway. This comparison helps understand the biochemical and genetic characteristics shared between BD and stroke. Predictive drug analysis has identified consistent potential biomarkers associated with both conditions, providing a scientific foundation for investigating their diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis. Finally, chemical experiments could be conducted to further validate the efficacy of these drugs.",Bioinformatics,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s42485-025-00181-z,1

"Ischemic stroke (IS) remains a major clinical challenge due to the difficulty of early diagnosis and incomplete understanding of its pathological mechanisms. Post-translational modifications (PTMs) regulate key cellular processes in IS, but their roles as diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets have not been fully elucidated. This study aimed to identify PTM-related genes (PTMRGs) associated with IS and evaluate their diagnostic and therapeutic potential using comprehensive bioinformatics and machine learning methods. Gene expression data from two GEO cohorts (GSE16561, training groupn= 63; GSE58294, testing groupn= 92) were analyzed. Differential expression analysis, weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), and intersection with known PTMRGs were performed to screen candidate genes. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks and machine learning algorithms (Boruta, SVM-RFE, LASSO) were used to prioritize biomarkers. The expression of key genes was validated in clinical samples by RT-qPCR. An artificial neural network (ANN) was constructed to evaluate diagnostic performance. In addition, immune infiltration, gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), gene-gene interaction (GGI), and molecular docking analyses were conducted to explore biological functions and therapeutic candidates. A total of 1465 upregulated genes and 1782 downregulated genes were identified. WGCNA revealed modules significantly associated with IS, yielding 75 key PTMRGs identified after intersection with DEGs and PTMRGs. Six genes (ATG7, KAT2A, RNF20, UBA1, UBE2I, and USP15) were identified as diagnostic markers with AUC > 0.7. RT-qPCR in 10 IS patients and 10 controls confirmed differential expression, consistent with bioinformatics results. The ANN model showed high diagnostic accuracy (AUC = 0.983 in training, 0.95 in testing). Functional enrichment linked these genes to ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis, DNA repair, and Myc signaling.

"The advancement of next-generation sequencing has spurred the growing adoption of whole-exome sequencing (WES) for genetic screening. Preimplantation genetic testing for monogenic disorders (PGT-M) can effectively prevent the transmission of pathogenic variants. However, interpreting vast data volumes and ensuring precise genetic counseling, especially with variants of uncertain significance (VUS), remains challenging. In this study, we investigated a family with recurrent fetal malformations detected by prenatal ultrasound. WES identified compound heterozygousPOMT1variants, c.1052 + 1G > A and c.1483G > A in the proband; the latter was initially categorized as a VUS. Then our bioinformatics analysis revealed that c.1483G > A variant was located in a highly conserved domain essential for POMT1’s enzymatic activity, potentially altering the protein’s 3D structure. In vitro studies using HEK293T cells showed that the variant led to aberrant POMT1 mRNA and protein accumulation, impaired cell viability, and abnormal protein localization in the cytoplasm, indicating disruption of normal glycosylation processes. Combining bioinformatics analysis with in vitro experiments, we reclassified the c.1483G > A variant as likely pathogenic. Subsequently, the couple opted for PGT-M, culminating in the birth of a healthy child. Our findings underscore the pivotal role of genetic testing in recurrent fetal malformations and expand the spectrum ofPOMT1variants. The successful reclassification of the variant by integrating in vitro experiments with bioinformatics provides substantial evidence for clinicians implementing PGT-M, offering a feasible strategy for counseling with VUS detected by WES.",Bioinformatics,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s43032-024-01761-y,1
"Gliomas are highly invasive and heterogeneous tumors in the central nervous system (CNS), characterized by poor prognosis and significant therapeutic challenges. The comprehensive understanding of their molecular mechanisms remains a critical focus and challenge in current research. This study aims to integrate bioinformatics and single-cell analysis technologies to explore glioma-related cell types and immune cell infiltration features, providing new insights into the molecular pathogenesis of gliomas and identifying potential therapeutic targets. Gene expression profiles were selected from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), and a glioma-related gene dataset was obtained from GeneCards. Single-cell analysis was employed to identify cell types, and bioinformatics techniques were applied to identify potential pathogenic targets in gliomas. A protein–protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed, followed by functional enrichment analysis using Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) databases. Ultimately, drug target prediction and molecular docking analysis revealed the mechanisms of potential drugs. Single-cell analysis identified 10 cell types, with microglial cells and oligodendrocytes playing crucial roles in gliomas. Molecular biological analysis identified 20 key genes. GO and KEGG analyses indicated that these hub genes were primarily enriched in processes such as cellular component organization or biogenesis, cellular processes, cell junctions, and catalytic activity. The main signaling pathways involved include the p53 signaling pathway, cell cycle, and cellular senescence. Furthermore, molecular docking results showed that quercetin effectively binds to four hub targets (DLGAP5, TOP2A, CHEK1, MKI67), suggesting that quercetin may improve glioma-related biological features by acting on these targets.

"Various long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have indicated their role in different regulatory processes and therapeutics in cervical cancer (CC). This study aims to assess the gene expression and methylation status ofLINC00518&MAFG-AS1in CC patients. Methylation-specific PCR (MS-PCR) and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) were performed on 81 patients. The association of the promoter methylation status of cancer tissues was studied with HPV infection and clinicopathological factors. The Kaplan-Meier curves were used from the GEPIA and TANRIC databases to analyze the overall survival of CC patients. The bioinformatics analysis of relative gene expression was carried out using the GEPIA database. The RNAinter database was also explored to find out the potential interacting partners. This is the first-ever research revealing that hypomethylation of theLINC00518gene promoter may be relevant to its oncogenic behavior in CC (p< 0.05). However, no significant difference was observed between theMAFG-AS1methylation status of cancerous and normal tissues. A notable association between the methylation status ofLINC00518promoter and clinicopathological factors, including age (p< 0.001), histological subtypes (p< 0.00001), and differentiation degree (p< 0.00001), has been observed, indicating its possible role in predicting the severity and prognosis of this disease. Overall survival analysis showed a significant value forLINC00518using GEPIA (p< 0.05).

"BackgroundChronic kidney disease (CKD) has emerged as a major health problem worldwide. Previous studies have shown that specific miRNA expression profiles of patients with CKD are significantly changed. In this study, we aim to elucidate the role of miRNAs as potential biomarkers in CKD progression by integrating bioinformatics analysis with experimental validation, thereby providing medical evidence for the prevention and treatment of CKD.MethodBioinformatics analysis was used to identify potential targets and pathways in CKD-associated renal fibrosis through randomly obtaining miRNA microarray data related to CKD patients in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria, conducting pathway enrichment analysis and constructing protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks and miRNA-mRNA network by Cytoscape 3.8.0. In vitro experiments were employed to verify the role and mechanism of miR-223-3p in human renal tubular epithelial cells (HK2) through Quantitative real-time PCR assays, Western blot, Immunofluorescence analysis and Double luciferase reporter gene experiment. Multi-group one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and the Dunnett-t test were uesd to analyze the results by SPSS24.0.Results10 up-regulated and 11 down-regulated miRNAs of CKD patients were screened out. Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase B (PI3K/Akt) was the first pathway of pathway enrichment analysis. MiR-223-3p (logFC=-2.047,p= 0.002) was one of the four hub miRNAs. Furthermore, we observed a reduction in α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) (p= 0.001) and Collagen type I alpha 1 (Col1-a1) (p= 0.023) levels upon miR-223-3p overexpression, which aligned with our bioinformatics predictions. This downregulation was attributed to the inhibition of nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB) nuclear translocation and subsequent decrease in the secretion of inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-6 (IL-6) (p= 0.005). Conversely, when CHUK was further overexpressed, the inhibitory effect of miR-223-3p on epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) was attenuated, confirming the specific interaction between miR-223-3p and CHUK.ConclusionOur findings provide compelling evidence that miR-223-3p acts as a suppressor of EMT in CKD by specifically targeting the CHUK and modulating the PI3K/Akt pathway, which holds great promise as a novel therapeutic target for CKD treatment. Additionally, this study offers a potential avenue for the development of future interventions aimed at halting or reversing the progression of CKD.",Bioinformatics,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12967-024-06058-x,1
"Ferroptosis is a programmed cell death mode associated with iron metabolism, with accumulation of intracellular lipid peroxides, which is closely related to the occurrence and development of multiple diseases, including type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). T2DM is a chronic metabolic disorder characterized by a combination of impaired insulin sensitivity and insufficient insulin production, frequently accompanied by obesity and fatty liver, which increases the risk of developing HCC. To explore the complex interactions between ferritin deposition, T2DM, and HCC, we performed bioinformatics analysis on publicly available gene expression data and identified 23 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) that are commonly expressed in both T2DM and HCC. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analyses revealed that these DEGs are primarily enriched in fatty acid metabolism and ferroptosis pathways. The weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) identified 6 key genes associated with the pathogenesis of both diseases. Taking the intersection of DEGs and iron deposition-related genes, we identified ACSL4 as a key ferroptosis gene involved in the co-morbidity of T2DM and HCC. To validate the bioinformatics findings, we assessed the expression of ACSL4 using Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, which revealed an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.886 for HCC and 0.745 for T2DM. Additionally, an insulin resistance model was established in HepG2 cells by treatment with 350 µM palmitic acid (PA), resulting in significant changes in cell morphology. Oil Red O staining showed a marked increase in lipid accumulation. RT-PCR analysis further confirmed the significant alteration in ACSL4 gene expression.

To make sense of biomedical data, the discipline of bioinformatics within nanotechnologies employs computational and mathematical techniques. Machine learning methods have recently advanced, making them much better at evaluating and predicting biological data if used appropriately. Hence, this article proposes a random forest-based algorithm on bioinformatics analysis in gene expression profiling (BA-GEP) framework for personalized healthcare for Parkinson's disease treatment. This research aims to examine gene sequences using machine learning techniques to discover groups with similar clinical characteristics of Parkinson's disease. First, indicated connectivity factor levels against every biomarker are used to determine differentially expressed areas based on the entire genome protein expression sequence information using the RF algorithm. Second, microarray technology helps convert genetic data from a biological source into a digital format. These findings provide light on the genetics and molecular basis of Parkinson's disease and may identify therapeutic options for the condition in the future. The outcome will aid in developing personalized medication recommendations by allowing the detection of variations that do not contribute to illness. The information may also be used to understand better genetic variation's role in determining how a person responds to a given treatment.",Bioinformatics,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11042-024-20066-5,1
"Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a common traumatic central nervous system disorder characterized by a complex microenvironment after injury, leading to severe neurological dysfunction. Increasing attention has been paid to the role of inflammatory cells in SCI. Pyroptosis, a form of programmed inflammatory cell death, plays a significant role in SCI; however, its underlying mechanisms remain unclear. This study utilized bioinformatics methods to identify pyroptosis-related genes (PRGs) and investigate their roles in inflammatory responses. Additionally, we explored the potential interactions between differentially expressed PRGs (DEPRGs) and miRNAs(microRNAs), lncRNAs(Long non-coding RNAs), and circRNAs(Circular RNAs). RNA expression profiles, including mRNA(Messenger RNA), miRNA, lncRNA, and circRNA, were obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. A total of 78 PRGs were identified through a literature search in PubMed. DEPRGs, miRNAs, lncRNAs, and circRNAs were screened using R software. Functional enrichment analyses of DEPRGs were performed, and a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed. Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) was conducted, and external validation was performed using an independent dataset to identify hub genes and their correlations with immune cells. Western blotting was used to validate hub gene expression. Finally, a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) network was constructed based on differentially expressed miRNAs (DEmiRNAs), lncRNAs (DElncRNAs), and circRNAs (DEcircRNAs). Eleven DEPRGs were identified in SCI, including ten upregulated and one downregulated gene. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analyses showed that DEPRGs were mainly enriched in processes such as the regulation of interleukin-1 beta production, NLRP3 inflammasome complex, and NOD-like receptor signaling pathway. Two hub genes,IL18andGSDMD, were identified using Cytoscape and WGCNA. External dataset validation revealed significant differences in hub gene expression between SCI and control groups (P< 0.05), with AUC(Area Under Curve) values > 0.75. Immune infiltration analysis indicated significant positive correlations between hub genes and M1 macrophages, CD8 + T cells, and resting dendritic cells. Four downregulated DEmiRNAs were identified as potential regulators of hub genes. Additionally, 29 DEmiRNAs, 55 upregulated DElncRNAs, and 2 upregulated DEcircRNAs were identified and used to construct the ceRNA network. Bioinformatics analyses revealed a strong association between pyroptosis and SCI, identifying two potential hub genes,IL18andGSDMD, linked to pyroptosis and immune cell infiltration. These findings provide insights into the potential mechanisms of pyroptosis in SCI and offer a basis for further studies.",Bioinformatics,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1038/s41598-025-10541-w,1
"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a malignant tumor with high morbidity and mortality rates worldwide and only presents symptoms in later stage; no ideal biomarker is available for the early diagnosis of CRC. Therefore, it is important to explore novel molecules that significantly contribute to CRC progression. The cohort contains different stages of CRC were downloaded and comprehensive bioinformatics analyses were performed by Mfuzz, Protein–Protein Interaction (PPI), MCODE, ESTIMATE, and ssGSEA.The results revealed that Protein Kinase, Membrane Associated Tyrosine/Threonine 1 (PKMYT1) served as a functional hub gene and its high expression might be associated with an immunosuppressive microenvironment, therapeutic sensitivity and tumor progression. PKMYT1-related genes are linked to DNA replication, the cell cycle, and mismatch repair, indicating PKMYT1 functions as an oncogene and potential biomarker in CRC development. Moreover, in vitro experimental investigation was conducted and the data found that CRC tumor tissues and cells have elevated PKMYT1 expression. Knockdown of PKMYT1 by siRNAs significantly impaired the proliferation, cell cycling, migration, and invasion of CRC cells. In summary, this study demonstrated that PKMYT1 may be a promising target for therapeutic intervention and play a significant role in the development of CRC.",Bioinformatics,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1038/s41598-025-18430-y,1

"IgA nephropathy (IgAN) is a prevalent primary glomerular disease and a major contributor to end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Budesonide Enteric Capsules (Nefecon®) are the first treatment approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) targeting galactose-deficient IgA1 (Gd-IgA1) synthesis in the terminal ileum for IgAN. However, the detailed molecular mechanisms underlying its efficacy remain to be fully elucidated. In this study, we utilized bioinformatics approaches to integrate data from the GeneCards, CTD, and OMIM databases, identifying 787 IgAN-related targets. Additionally, we employed the PharmMapper, CTD and TargetNet databases to predict 384 budesonide targets, ultimately pinpointing 122 common targets. GO and KEGG enrichment analyses indicated that these targets are significantly enriched in biological processes such as apoptosis, inflammation responses, and cell proliferation, as well as in key pathways, including pathways in cancer, the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, and the IL-17 signaling pathway. Protein–protein interaction (PPI) network analysis identified 10 core targets, including IL-6, TNF, AKT1, and TGF-β1, all of which exhibited strong binding affinity with budesonide in molecular docking studies.

"The activation of the PPARG transcription factor is linked to reduced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) growth. Bioinformatics, cheminformatics, and molecular docking/dynamics studies assessing pioglitazone and telmisartan as repurposed PPARG agonists for treating NSCLC with a targeted delivery system was done. Bioinformatics confirmed that the expression of the PPARG gene can predict outcomes in lung adenocarcinoma and is related to immune cells present in the tumor. Cheminformatics data showed that pioglitazone and telmisartan have a strong attraction to the PPARG receptor, with good efficiency as ligands. Both drugs were found to be lipophilic, suggesting compatibility with a targeted delivery formulation that may include albumin. Further cheminformatics predictions highlighted systemic toxicity values and the need for targeted delivery to minimize toxic side effects. Molecular docking and dynamics simulations showed that the telmisartan-MyoVc cargo domain complex was strong and stable during an 18 ns simulation period. Bioinformatics and cheminformatics data support pioglitazone and telmisartan as promising repurposed drugs for LUAC, highlighting their lipophilicity and compatibility with exosomal components like albumin.

"BackgroundTo explore the causal relationship between serum albumin and venous thromboembolism (VTE) comprises deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and its consequential condition, pulmonary embolism (PE), through Mendelian randomization (MR) design, seeking to clarify the protective roles of albumin in the development of venous thrombosis.MethodsWe performed a bidirectional two-sample Mendelian randomization analysis utilizing albumin genome-wide association study (GWAS) data alongside VTE datasets from various sources. Additionally, to minimize heterogeneity across different datasets, a meta-analysis of the Mendelian randomization results was conducted. Furthermore, genes associated with such exposures were identified to unravel how exposure impacts outcomes. This was followed by applying bioinformatics techniques for gene enrichment analysis and employing the Cytoscape software to pinpoint the hub genes.ResultsThe findings from the meta-analysis of the Mendelian randomization indicate that reduced levels of albumin are associated with an elevated risk of VTE (OR = 0.739, 95% CI: 0.695 to 0.787,P= 1.82e-9), DVT (OR = 0.700, 95% CI: 0.646 to 0.772,P= 2.96e-15), and PE (OR = 0.717, 95% CI: 0.647 to 0.793,P= 1.74e-10).

"This study leverages bioinformatics to identify differential genes linked to lysosomal alterations in late-onset major depressivedisorder (LOD) patients and explores potential therapeutic drugs. We analyzed differential genes in the GSE76826 dataset usingWGCNA to identify modules associated with LOD. After intersecting with lysosomal genes, we utilized ROC and Lasso regression toassess diagnostic significance. Pathway enrichment analysis was conducted on key modules, followed by CIBESORT, MCPcounter,and quanTIseq to analyze immune infiltration in LOD patients. The changes in the expression of selected genes were confirmedthrough a chronic unpredictable mild stress model. The ITCM database predicted small molecule drugs targeting lysosome-relatedgenes.

"The incidence of both prostate cancer (PCa) and metabolic syndrome (MS) has been steadily increasing due to changes in population structure and lifestyle. These two conditions frequently co-occur, yet their shared pathogenic mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, we utilized bioinformatics and machine learning techniques to analyze public datasets and validated our findings using clinical specimens from our center to identify common signature genes between PCa and MS. We began by screening differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and module genes through Linear models for microarray analysis (Limma) and Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) of four microarray datasets from the GEO database (PCa: GSE8511, GSE32571, and GSE104749; MS: GSE98895). Comprehensively bioinformatics analyses, including functional enrichment, LASSO, and random forest algorithms, coupled with receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and precision recall curve (PRC) analyses were conducted. We identified 423 DEGs in the PCa dataset and 2481 differentially modular genes in the MS dataset. Among these, 52 intersection genes enriched in immunomodulatory pathways were found. Three common signature genes, namely GPD1L, ACY1, and C12orf75, were identified through LASSO and random forest analyses. Subsequent validation using clinical specimens confirmed differential expression of these genes in PCa, with survival analysis indicating that elevated expression of ACY1 is associated with adverse prognosis in PCa patients. Additionally, immunoinfiltration analysis revealed higher levels of macrophage M0 and activated dendritic cells in PCa tissues. In summary, our study identifies three shared signature genes between PCa and MS, with ACY1 demonstrating adverse prognostic significance in PCa. Our findings provide a foundation for elucidating the pathogenic mechanisms and interplay between PCa and MS, offering novel insights for identifying potential therapeutic targets in PCa.",Bioinformatics,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12672-025-02561-9,1
"Wuzi Yanzong Pill (WZYZP) is a traditional Chinese medicine formula extensively used in China to treat male reproductive dysfunction, with a specific focus on invigorating the kidney. Despite its observed efficacy, the exact mechanisms and therapeutic targets remain unclear. The primary goal of this study is to elucidate the potential molecular targets and underlying mechanisms of WZYZP in the treatment of asthenozoospermia (AZS). It will be achieved through the integration of network pharmacology and bioinformatics analyses in a comprehensive and systematic approach. This study employed bioinformatics analysis and network pharmacology methodologies, encompassing: construction of protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks; development of ‘Ingredients-Potential Target Genes-Signaling Pathways’ (IPS) networks; Gene Ontology (GO) functional annotation and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis; differential gene analysis; molecular docking; and molecular dynamics simulations (MDS). Through network pharmacology analysis, we identified 485 potential targets of WZYZP. Cross-referencing with disease databases resulted in 57 intersecting targets pertinent to both WZYZP and AZS. Construction of the IPS network further determined eight core candidate targets:PIK3R1,MAPK3,GSK3B,AKT1,MAPK14,ESR1,ESR2, andCYP17A1. GO and KEGG pathway enrichment analyses highlighted significant involvement in prolactin signaling, endocrine resistance, and estrogen signaling pathways. Molecular docking and MDS confirmed stable binding of WZYZP components to all eight core targets. Our findings suggest that WZYZP may exert therapeutic effects in AZS by targeting eight pivotal genes (PIK3R1,MAPK3,GSK3B,AKT1,MAPK14,ESR1,ESR2,and CYP17A1). This is achieved through modulation of prolactin signaling, estrogen signaling, and endocrine resistance, thereby inhibiting inflammatory damage, antagonizing apoptotic signaling, maintaining hormonal homeostasis, and restoring metabolic imbalance.",Bioinformatics,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12013-025-01835-x,1
"BackgroundHepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third leading cause of cancer related death, and its molecular mechanisms have not been fully elucidated. This study aims to elucidate the molecular mechanisms linking pyroptosis and immune microenvironment changes in HCC, with a focus on macrophage polarization and inflammatory responses.MethodsSelected gene expression profiles from the Gene Expression Omnibus database, established protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks, and performed functional enrichment analysis using databases such as the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG). The expression of relevant hub genes was verified by immunohistochemistry, real-time quantitative PCR, and Western Blot based on clinical tissues. Single-cell identification of HCC cell types and malignant cells, trajectory analysis, and intercellular signal communication further analyzed the molecular mechanisms between immune cells and liver cells. Bioinformatics combined with single-cell analysis to elucidate the immune pyroptosis molecular mechanism that underlay the development of HCC.ResultsMolecular biology has identified six pyroptosis hub genes in HCC. The key hub genes of immune pyroptosis were validated through immunohistochemistry and in vitro experiments. Enrichment analysis shows that intersecting genes are enriched in immune responses, chemokine mediated signaling pathways, and inflammatory responses. InferCNV and copyKAT accurately predict that malignant cells distribute in HCC tissues, and their main malignant cells may be hepatocytes, endothelium and epithelial cells. Cell trajectory analysis found that monocyte, macrophage polarization could play a first role in HCC. The cellular clustering of single cells revealed the infiltration of immune cells, especially the polarization of macrophages, which plays an important role. Immunohistochemistry suggests that hub genes such as HMGB1, CYCS, GSDMD, IL-1β, NLRP3, and IL18 are the link between macrophage polarization and pyroptosis during HCC development.ConclusionsIn summary, the main molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of HCC are related to immune cell infiltration, particularly macrophage infiltration polarization that promotes the secretion of inflammatory factors leading to hepatocyte pyroptosis. These findings provide novel insights into the macrophage-driven pyroptosis pathways in HCC, potentially paving the way for new immunotherapeutic strategies.",Bioinformatics,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12672-025-02907-3,1
"Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is one of the most common metabolic diseases in pregnant women, posing significant risks to the life and health of both mothers and fetuses. With improving living standards, the incidence of GDM is increasing rapidly. Therefore, understanding the underlying mechanism of GDM is of paramount importance. We downloaded two datasets from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database, containing sequencing data specifically related to “gestational diabetes” and “placenta”. By merging these two datasets, a mRNA expression dataset was obtained and subjected to bioinformatics analyses. To screen out corresponding genes, differential analysis and weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA) were carried out. Lasso, support vector machine and random forest analyses were subsequently performed for identifying key genes from the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) jointly screened out through differential analysis and WGCNA. Afterwards, immunoinfiltration and correlation analysis were performed to screen immune cells that play a role in disease progression and explore the correlation between the screened key genes and immune cells, after which Western Blot, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, Immunohistochemistry, methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium, flow cytometry, scratch and Transwell assays were, respectively, performed for verification. For further verification, we found that the expression levels of MAP6D1 and SCUBE1 in embryonic tissues of GDM patients was higher compared to those of healthy pregnant women, which was consistent with the results of bioinformatics analysis. Consequently, SCUBE1 was selected for follow-up experiment. In order to explore the role of SCUBE1 in the development of GDM, we treated the trophoblastic cells HTR-8/SVneo with high glucose, and on this basis downregulated the expression of SCUBE1. Through further analysis, we observed that SCUBE1 had a role in reducing cell activity, migration and invasion, and promoting cell apoptosis. In summary, SCUBE1 promotes the development of GDM by increasing cell apoptosis and reducing cell activity, migration, and invasion.",Bioinformatics,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10528-024-10769-7,1
"Minichromosome maintenance protein 5 (MCM5) has emerged as a prominent oncogenic across multiple malignancies. However, its role in glioblastoma (GBM) remains unclear. This study investigates the mechanistic role of MCM5 in GBM pathogenesis. We performed pan-cancer analysis of MCM5 by public datasets (TCGA, GTEx), with particular focus on its expression in GBM, and functional validation by siRNA-mediated knockdown in GBM cell lines (LN18, U87). GO enrichment analysis of MCM5 and its related functional genes was performed using the Metascape database to identify MCM5-related pathways. We subsequently used a variety of experimental methods to thoroughly examine the effect of MCM5 dysfunction on cellular functions, including a subcutaneous hypodermic tumour transplantation model in nude mice, flow cytometry, Transwell assays and wound healing assays. MCM5 exhibited significant overexpression in GBM tissues compared to normal controls. Furthermore, MCM5 expression demonstrated positive correlations with Th2 cells, aCD, and other immune cells. Gene enrichment analysis suggested that MCM5 plays a role in cancer development by regulating deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) replication. In vitro and in vivo experiments showed that MCM5 enhances GBM cell proliferation, migratory capacity, and cell cycle progression. By bioinformatics analysis and cell experiments, MCM5 is found to promote the progression of GBM by accelerating cell cycle.

"Nature-inspired or biomimetic catalysts aim to reach the high catalytic performance and selectivity of natural enzymes while possessing the chemical stability and processability of synthetic catalysts. A promising strategy for designing biomimetic catalysts relies on mimicking the structure of the enzyme active site. This can either entail complicated total synthesis of a synthetic catalyst or design of peptide sequences, able to self-assemble in the presence of metal ions, thus forming metallo-peptide complexes that mimic the active sites of natural enzymes. Using a bioinformatics approach, we designed a minimal peptide made up of eight amino acids (H4pep) to act as a functional mimic of the trinuclear Cu site of the laccase enzyme. Cu(II) binding to H4pep results in the formation of a Cu2+(H4pep)2complex with a β-sheet secondary structure, able to reduce O2.

"Previous studies have identified an association between per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) and the occurrence of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC), but the specific mechanisms remain unclear. This study aims to analyze the toxicological mechanisms of PFAS, particularly perfluoroctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonate (), on ICC through network toxicology and bioinformatics. Relevant targets for PFOS and PFOA were retrieved from the CTD, ChEMBL, and Super-PRED databases. Targets related to ICC were gathered from the GeneCards, NCBI, and OMIM databases. Common targets between ICC and PFOS, PFOA were identified and subjected to median filtering in CytoHubba to select core targets, which were then analyzed for protein–protein interaction using the STRING database. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analyses were performed on core targets to elucidate the biological processes affected by PFAS in ICC. The intersection of the targets for ICC and those from PFOS/PFOA was compared with the differentially expressed genes in ICC from the TCGA database. LASSO regression was applied to filter prediction targets, and bioinformatics analysis was conducted to assess the differential expression of these targets in ICC, constructing a risk assessment model. Molecular docking was utilized to evaluate the binding affinity of PFOA and PFOS to the predicted targets. A total of 1,838 and 2,616 targets were predicted for PFOA and PFOS, respectively; whereas, for ICC, 2,044 targets were identified, with 345 and 459 common targets for PFOA and PFOS, respectively. GO and KEGG enrichment analyses revealed that these processes were primarily associated with biological functions such as cell proliferation and apoptosis, potentially mediated by the PI3K-Akt and HIF-1 signaling pathways. The integrated analysis of differentially expressed genes from the TCGA database and the intersection of targets from PFOA/PFOS with those from ICC yielded five core genes (TP53, ESR1, CDH1, BCL2, and MMP9) that formed an ICC prognostic score with robust predictive capability for survival, classifying ICC patients into high-risk and low-risk groups (p< 0.05). Molecular docking simulations demonstrated strong binding affinities between PFAS and these core targets, supporting their potential roles in PFAS-induced ICC development. This study explores the potential key mechanisms underlying PFAS-induced ICC and highlights core biomarkers that could serve as therapeutic targets. These results are expected to offer novel perspectives on strategies for the prevention and treatment of ICC.",Bioinformatics,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1038/s41598-025-19590-7,1
"Alcohol abuse, also known as Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD), is a substance dependency psychiatric disorder. We aimed to establish a causal relationship between specific gut microbiota and alcohol abuse using Mendelian Randomisation (MR) and bioinformatics methods. We acquired summary data of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for gut microbiota and alcohol abuse from the Mibiogen and Finngen databases, respectively. We conducted MR analyses using various methodologies and mapped the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to genes via the FUMA GWAS platform. We further performed multiple enrichment analyses and a Multi-variable Mendelian Randomisation (MVMR) approach to examine whether gut microbiota influences alcohol abuse by modulating neurotransmitter-related amino acids. The MR analysis revealed an inverse relationship between the genusEubacterium ventriosum groupand thePorphyromonadaceae familywith alcohol abuse.

"Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is a prevalent degenerative joint disease and a leading cause of disability worldwide. While traditionally considered a mechanical disorder, accumulating evidence highlights the critical role of dysregulated immune responses in OA pathogenesis. Despite this, specific immune-related biomarkers for early diagnosis remain poorly defined. This study aims to systematically identify and validate immune-related molecular signatures involved in knee OA, providing potential diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets. We applied integrated bioinformatics and machine-learning approaches to identify immune-related biomarkers specific to OA and validated their expression through in vitro experiments. Two immune-related hub genes, BCL6 and HMGB2, were found to be significantly downregulated in OA cartilage. Both demonstrated strong diagnostic performance and were consistently validated across external datasets and in vitro assays. This study identifies BCL6 and HMGB2 as robust immune-related biomarkers in knee OA, providing new insights into disease mechanisms and potential avenues for early diagnosis and therapeutic intervention.",Bioinformatics,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10616-025-00876-7,1
"BackgroundBreast cancer (BC) is a malignant tumor characterized by a high incidence rate and is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths among women worldwide. This study aims to identify key genes and potential prognostic biomarkers using a bioinformatics approach.MethodsThree microarray datasets, GSE86374, GSE120129, and GSE29044, were downloaded from the GEO database. GEO2R and Venn diagram software were employed to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs), while DAVID was utilized for functional enrichment analysis. Subsequently, STRING and Cytoscape were used to construct the protein–protein interaction (PPI) network among the DEGs. UALCAN, GEPIA, and the Kaplan–Meier plotter were employed for prognostic analysis. Following this, the correlations and alterations of key genes were examined using cBioPortal. Finally, immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed to validate the expression levels of the key genes.ResultsA total of 323 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified. From the protein–protein interaction (PPI) network, 37 hub genes were selected. Validation using UALCAN, GEPIA, and Kaplan–Meier plotters revealed that three key genes—RACGAP1,SPAG5, andKIF20A—were significantly overexpressed and associated with poor prognosis in breast cancer (BC), as well as advanced tumor staging. The correlations and alterations of these key genes, as demonstrated on cBioPortal, indicated that their alterations co-occurred.

"Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) and insomnia are age-related neurological disorders increasingly recognized as being closely associated. However, research on the shared genes and their biological mechanisms remains limited. This study aims to identify common genes between CAA and insomnia and explore their potential molecular mechanisms, offering new insights for diagnosis and treatment. Blood samples were collected from 11 CAA patients and 11 healthy controls, followed by RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). Additionally, the microarray dataset GSE208668 for the insomnia cohort was downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. Differential expression analysis was performed to identify common differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks and machine learning methods Random Forest (RF) and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) were used to narrow down key genes. We explored the biological functions of these genes through immune cell infiltration, metabolic and Hallmark pathway analyses, and clinical correlation analysis. Co-expression networks, drug-mRNA networks, transcription factor (TF)–mRNA–miRNA networks, and competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) networks were also constructed. Finally, hub gene expression patterns were analyzed using the Human Protein Atlas (HPA) database, and validation was performed in clinical samples and animal models using quantitative Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (qRT-PCR) and Western blot. Differential expression analysis identified 185 DEGs. PPI network construction and machine learning methods identified CBX5 and POLR1B as common hub genes for both insomnia and CAA. Immune infiltration, metabolic, and Hallmark pathway analyses revealed these hub genes play distinct roles in each disease. Various network models were constructed to explore their regulatory mechanisms. The reliability of the hub genes was validated using bioinformatics analyses and experimental approaches.

"There is evidence that allergic diseases are associated with carcinogenesis. According to translational and epidemiological data, it appears that different cancer types yield different associations. We investigated the relationship between allergic diseases and 28 cancers by Mendelian randomization. Quantitative trait locus analysis was utilized to determine genes expressed in kidney tissue that were affected by allergy-related loci. We further explored the underlying molecular mechanism between allergic diseases and renal cell carcinoma (RCC) with bioinformatics. Of the 28 cancers, evidence suggested that allergies specifically suppressed kidney cancer. Seventy single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with allergic diseases affected the expression of 134 genes in kidney tissue. These 134 genes were enriched in immune-related pathways represented by the major histocompatibility complex class II antigen presentation pathway. Among them, seven core genes were significantly positively correlated with T helper 2 cells. Allergic diseases specifically suppressed RCC through multiple immune pathways. Among them, the major histocompatibility complex class II antigen presentation pathway and T helper 2 cells were the most critical.

"MotivationMany bioinformatics problems can be approached as optimization or controlled sampling tasks, and solved exactly and efficiently using Dynamic Programming (DP). However, such exact methods are typically tailored towards specific settings, complex to develop, and hard to implement and adapt to problem variations.MethodsWe introduce the Infrared framework to overcome such hindrances for a large class of problems. Its underlying paradigm is tailored toward problems that can be declaratively formalized as sparse feature networks, a generalization of constraint networks. Classic Boolean constraints specify a search space, consisting of putative solutions whose evaluation is performed through a combination of features. Problems are then solved using generic cluster tree elimination algorithms over a tree decomposition of the feature network. Their overall complexities are linear on the number of variables, and only exponential in the treewidth of the feature network. For sparse feature networks, associated with low to moderate treewidths, these algorithms allow to find optimal solutions, or generate controlled samples, with practical empirical efficiency.ResultsImplementing these methods, the Infrared software allows Python programmers to rapidly develop exact optimization and sampling applications based on a tree decomposition-based efficient processing. Instead of directly coding specialized algorithms, problems are declaratively modeled as sets of variables over finite domains, whose dependencies are captured by constraints and functions. Such models are then automatically solved by generic DP algorithms. To illustrate the applicability of Infrared in bioinformatics and guide new users, we model and discuss variants of bioinformatics applications. We provide reimplementations and extensions of methods for RNA design, RNA sequence-structure alignment, parsimony-driven inference of ancestral traits in phylogenetic trees/networks, and design of coding sequences. Moreover, we demonstrate multidimensional Boltzmann sampling. These applications of the framework—together with our novel results—underline the practical relevance of Infrared. Remarkably, the achieved complexities are typically equivalent to the ones of specialized algorithms and implementations.AvailabilityInfrared is available athttps://amibio.gitlabpages.inria.fr/Infraredwith extensive documentation, including various usage examples and API reference; it can be installed using Conda or from source.",Bioinformatics,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s13015-024-00258-2,1
"Nucleotide metabolism (NM) is a fundamental process that enables the rapid growth of tumors. Glioblastoma (GBM) primarily relies on NM for its invasion, leading to severe clinical outcomes. This study focuses on NM to identify potential biomarkers associated with GBM. Publicly available databases were used as the primary data source for this study, excluding biological tissue samples. We identified and evaluated key genes involved in NM, followed by developing and validating a prognostic model. Patients were classified into high- and low-risk groups based on this model, and the two groups were compared with respect to cellular immunity and mutation profiles. The biomarkers were confirmed using real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Our study identifiedUPP1,CDA,NUDT1, andADSLas significant biomarkers associated with prognosis, all of which were upregulated in patients with GBM. The risk score and clinical factors such as age, sex, GBM stage, MGMT promoter status, and IDH mutation status were found to be independent prognostic factors. Patients with glioblastoma showed a higher overall mutation burden. Using bioinformatics, this study identifies key factors associated with NM in GBM that may influence patient prognosis.

"Ischemic stroke (IS) is a leading global cause of mortality and disability, particularly prominent in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Despite clinical evidence of their comorbidity, the molecular mechanisms underlying their interaction remain elusive. This study aims to identify shared biomarkers, gene regulatory networks, and therapeutic targets through integrative bioinformatics analyses. Gene expression datasets for IS (GSE16561, GSE22255) and ESRD (GSE37171, GSE142153) were obtained from gene expression omnibus (GEO). Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) and differential expression genes (DEGs) analysis identified shared genes and enriched pathways. Protein-protein interaction networks were constructed using STRING with clustering algorithms. Immune cell infiltration analysis was performed via CIBERSORT. Transcriptional regulatory networks were predicted using RcisTarget and miRcode. Key gene expressions were validated by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) in clinical samples. We identified 417 intersecting genes through WGCNA and 1712 shared differentially expressed genes. Among these, seven key genes (MRPL49, MRPS2, MRPS9, MRPS10, MRPS11, MRPS27, TFB1M) demonstrated central roles in mitochondrial function. Immune infiltration analysis revealed significant correlations with T cells and neutrophils. Pathway enrichment implicated these genes in transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) signaling, p53 pathway, and G2/M checkpoint. Clinical validation confirmed significant downregulation of MRPS9, MRPS10, MRPS11, MRPS27 and TFB1M in comorbid patients.

This study aimed to explore the relationship between BMRGs and colon cancer.MethodsData from Colorectal Cancer (CRC) were extracted from the Xena and GEO databases, with 224 BMRGs identified from CRC sequencing data. A single-cell data set (GSE132465) was analyzed to compute BM scores, followed by correlation analysis. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were derived from the TCGA–COAD colon cancer data set. Prognosis-associated characteristic genes were identified using univariate Cox, Lasso–Cox, and random survival forest (RSF) methods. These genes were incorporated into a multivariate Cox regression model to calculate risk scores. A clinical predictive model was constructed and validated using the GSE103479 data set. Key gene expression differences between tumor and normal tissues were validated through immunohistochemical (IHC) staining.ResultsThree BMRGs have been identified as prognostic markers for colorectal cancer: GPC2, UNC5D, and SPOCK3. These genes exhibited higher expression levels in cancer tissues compared to adjacent normal tissues. Risk scores for each sample were calculated, categorizing them into high-risk and low-risk groups. The model was validated by constructing an optimal predictive model. Analysis of immune infiltration demonstrated a notable elevation in CD4 + T cell populations and a substantial reduction in CD8 + T cell populations within high-risk groups when contrasted with low-risk groups. Immune function analysis indicated reduced scores for APC co-stimulation, CCR, MHC class I, Th1 cells, and Th2 cells in high-risk groups. IHC confirmed elevated expression of GPC2, UNC5D, and SPOCK3 in colorectal cancer tissues, consistent with bioinformatics findings.ConclusionsThe expression levels of GPC2, UNC5D, and SPOCK3 serve as prognostic biomarkers for colorectal cancer, as demonstrated by bioinformatics analysis and IHC.

"The study focused on the regulatory role ofCarthamus tinctoriusDof in the safflower seed oil biosynthetic pathway. Through bioinformatics analysis, yeast expression system validation, and transgenicArabidopsis thalianaexperiments, it was found that the expression of the safflower family of transcription factors was significantly increased at 25 post-flowering days of safflower seed development, which coincided with the peak of fatty acid accumulation. Stearic acid content was reduced by 20.33% and oleic acid content was increased by 27.54% in transgenic yeast, and C20:0 and C22:0 long-chain saturated fatty acids were detected.Arabidopsis thalianaseeds overexpressing the safflower Dof transcription factor gene had significantly higher fatty acid composition than the wild type, while mutant seeds had lower fatty acid composition than the wild type.

"Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is one of the most common types of lung cancer and a leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide. This study aimed to identify key microRNAs (miRNAs) and genes involved in LUAD pathogenesis. We enrolled 50 patients diagnosed with early-stage LUAD between October 2021 and September 2023 as the observation group, along with 50 healthy individuals as the control group. Peripheral blood samples (5 mL) were collected from each participant for exosome isolation and quantitative analysis of miR-21. The results demonstrated that miR-21 expression was significantly higher in the observation group compared to the control group (P< 0.05). To further explore the molecular mechanisms underlying LUAD, publicly available RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) datasets were analyzed using bioinformatics approaches. Differential expression analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)-LUAD and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) datasets identified 296 differentially expressed miRNAs (192 upregulated, 104 downregulated) and 2942 differentially expressed genes (1691 upregulated, 1251 downregulated). Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analyses indicated that miR-21 target genes are involved in critical biological processes, including cell proliferation, apoptosis, and signal transduction. A protein–protein interaction (PPI) network analysis revealed key protein modules associated with LUAD progression.Immunohistochemistry (IHC) confirmed the high expression of miR-21 target genes IL12A and TGFBI in LUAD tissues. Additionally, the interaction between miR-21 and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) was explored, revealing complex regulatory networks. Gene co-expression analysis of the miR-21 target gene ZNF367 identified highly correlated genes associated with mitosis and DNA repair. Immune infiltration analysis using CIBERSORT demonstrated significant differences in immune cell composition between LUAD patients and healthy controls. Survival analysis further indicated that high miR-21 expression is associated with poorer prognosis, underscoring its potential as a prognostic biomarker.Furthermore, scRNA-seq provided insights into the dynamic molecular changes occurring during the transition from normal to malignant states. Collectively, these findings highlight the critical role of miR-21 in LUAD pathogenesis and suggest potential avenues for targeted therapies and personalized treatment strategies.",Bioinformatics,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1038/s41598-025-21742-8,1
"BackgroundAutophagy plays essential roles in the development and pathogenesis of mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (mTLE). In this research, we aim to identify and validate the autophagy-related genes associated with mTLE through bioinformatics analysis and experimental validations.MethodsWe obtained the dataset GSE143272 and high-throughput sequencing results of mTLE from public databases. Potential differentially expressed autophagy-related genes related to mTLE were identified using R software. Subsequently, genomes pathway enrichment analysis, protein-protein interactions (PPIs), and the gene ontology (GO) enrichment were performed for the selected autophagy-related genes. The mRNA expression profiles of hub genes were then used to establish a least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) model. Finally, seven hub candidate autophagy-related genes were confirmed in hippocampus using the lithium-pilocarpine chronic epilepsy model.ResultsA total of 40 differential expression genes (DEGs) among the core autophagy-related genes were identified. The analysis results of PPI revealed that interactions among these DEGs. KEGG pathway and GO analysis of selected candidate autophagy-related genes indicated that those enriched terms mainly focused on macroautophagy, regulation of autophagy, cellular response to extracellular stimulus and mitochondrion disassembly. The results suggested thatSQSTM1, VEGFA, BNIPandWIPI2were consistent with the bioinformatics analysis. The expression levels ofSQSTM1andVEGFAin epilepsy model samples were significantly higher than those in normal control, whileBNIPandWIPI2expression levels were notably decreased.

"Ischemic stroke leads to permanent damage to the affected brain tissue, with strict time constraints for effective treatment. Predictive biomarkers demonstrate great potential in the clinical diagnosis of ischemic stroke, significantly enhancing the accuracy of early identification, thereby enabling clinicians to intervene promptly and reduce patient disability and mortality rates. Furthermore, the application of predictive biomarkers facilitates the development of personalized treatment plans tailored to the specific conditions of individual patients, optimizing treatment outcomes and improving prognoses. Bioinformatics technologies based on high-throughput data provide a crucial foundation for comprehensively understanding the biological characteristics of ischemic stroke and discovering effective predictive targets. In this study, we evaluated gene expression data from ischemic stroke patients retrieved from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database, conducting differential expression analysis and functional analysis. Through weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), we characterized gene modules associated with ischemic stroke. To screen candidate core genes, three machine learning algorithms were applied, including Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO), random forest (RF), and support vector machine-recursive feature elimination (SVM-RFE), ultimately identifying five candidate core genes: MBOAT2, CKAP4, FAF1, CLEC4D, and VIM.

"ObjectiveRosmarinic acid (RosA) is a natural polyphenol compound that has been shown to be effective in the treatment of inflammatory disease and a variety of malignant tumors. However, its specific mechanism for the treatment of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) has not been fully elucidated. Therefore, this study aims to clarify the mechanism of RosA in the treatment of LUAD by integrating bioinformatics, network pharmacology and in vivo experiments, and to explore the potential of the active ingredients of traditional Chinese medicine in treating LUAD.MethodsFirstly, the network pharmacology was used to screen the RosA targets, and LUAD-related differential expressed genes (DEGs) were acquired from the GEO database. The intersection of LUAD regulated by RosA (RDEGs) was obtained through the Venn diagram. Secondly, GO and KEGG enrichment analysis of RDEGs were performed, and protein–protein interaction networks (PPIs) were constructed to identify and visualize hub RDEGs. Then, molecular docking between hub RDEGs and RosA was performed, and further evaluation was carried out by using bioinformatics for the predictive value of the hub RDEGs. Finally, the mechanism of RosA in the treatment of LUAD was verified by establishing a xenograft model of NSCLC in nude mouse.ResultsBioinformatics and other analysis showed that, compared with the control group, the expressions of MMP-1, MMP-9, IGFBP3 and PLAU in LUAD tissues were significantly up-regulated, and the expressions of PPARG and FABP4 were significantly down-regulated, and these hub RDEGs had potential predictive value for LUAD. In vivo experimental results showed that RosA could inhibit the growth of transplanted tumors in nude mice bearing tumors of lung cancer cells, reduce the positive expression of Ki67 in lung tumor tissue, and hinder the proliferation of lung tumor cells. Upregulated expression of PPARG and FABP4 by activating the PPAR signaling pathway increases the level of ROS in lung tumor tissues and promotes apoptosis of lung tumor cells. In addition, RosA can also reduce the expression of MMP-9 and IGFBP3, inhibit the migration and invasion of lung tumor tissue cells.ConclusionsThis study demonstrated that RosA could induce apoptosis by regulating the PPAR signaling pathway and the expression of MMP-9, inhibit the proliferation, migration and invasion of lung cancer cells, thereby exerting anti-LUAD effects.

"Ferroptosis is an important pathological mechanism of chronic heart failure (CHF). This study aimed to investigate the protective mechanism of Astragaloside IV (AS-IV) on CHF rats by integrating bioinformatics and ferroptosis. CHF-related targets and ferroptosis-related targets were collected. After the intersection, the common targets were obtained. The PPI network of the common targets was constructed, and topological analysis of the network was carried out. The target with the highest topological parameter values was selected as the key target. The key target p53 was obtained through bioinformatics analysis, and its molecular docking model with AS-IV was obtained, as well as molecular dynamics simulation analysis. The rat models of CHF after myocardial infarction were established by ligation of left coronary artery and treated with AS-IV for 4 weeks. AS-IV treatment significantly improved cardiac function in CHF rats, improved cardiomyocyte morphology and myocardial fibrosis, reduced mitochondrial damage, decreased myocardial MDA and Fe2+content, increased GSH content, inhibited the expression of p53 and p-p53, and up-regulated the expression of SLC7A11 and GPX4.

"Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) continues to pose a substantial risk to human lives worldwide. Endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) is increasingly recognized as one of the potential mechanisms of myocardial injury following AMI. The primary goal of this study is to investigate the correlation between ERS and AMI through machine learning-based bioinformatics analysis, explore key genes, and conduct in vivo and in vitro experimental validation. We performed differential analysis and Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) on gene expression data from the GEO database (GSE62646). The intersection with ERS-related genes (ERSRGs) was taken to obtain AMI-ERS-related genes (MIEGs), and machine learning algorithms were further used to identify key genes (Hubs) from the MIEGs. The validation set GSE59867 was used to assess the expression levels and predictive capabilities of the Hubs for AMI. An AMI rat model was established to detect the mRNA and protein expression levels of the Hubs. The protein inhibitor of the key gene FURIN was used to treat H9C2 cells under oxygen–glucose deprivation (OGD) to explore the effects of FURIN on ERS and apoptosis. Bioinformatics analysis identified 27 MIEGs, and machine learning further determined 5 Hubs highly associated with AMI and ERS: RELA, FURIN, ERGIC3, TPP1, and BGLAP. The expression of these Hubs was significantly elevated in AMI patients within both the training and validation sets, and the area under the curve (AUC) indicated good diagnostic value. Our experiments confirmed that the mRNA levels of Furin and RelA were significantly elevated in AMI rats. Furin protein was increased in AMI rats and OGD H9C2. Furin inhibitor could alleviate OGD-induced ERS and apoptosis in H9C2. Our study demonstrates that Hubs play a pivotal role in myocardial infarction.

In prior research, a strain ofEscherichia colinamed SDB2, isolated from chicken cecum, was found to degrade sinapine (a phenolic constituent of rapeseed meal) through the secretion of laccase CueO. Herein, the cloning, expression, and bioinformatics analysis of the CueO gene derived fromE. coliSDB2 are reported.Methods and resultsSequence analysis indicated that SDB2 CueO comprised 1551 bp, 516 amino acids, a putative molecular weight of 56.65 kDa, and an isoelectric point (pI) of 6.21. BLAST comparisons showed that the CueO protein sequence fromE. coliSDB2 exhibited 65–90% identity with CueO from other bacteria. Multiple alignment analysis further confirmed the similarity and identity of SDB2 CueO with CueO from other species, and the amino acids surrounding the Cu-binding sites were highly conserved. A phylogenetic tree demonstrated a close evolutionary relationship between CueO fromE. coliand CueO fromCitrobacter amalonaticus. The three-dimensional (3D) structural model revealed four copper (Cu)-binding regions. Recombinant CueO was successfully obtained by expressing the CueO gene inE. coliBL21 after isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) induction.

"The application of bioinformatics has revolutionized the practice of medicine in the past 20 years. From early studies that uncovered subtypes of cancer to broad efforts spearheaded by the Cancer Genome Atlas initiative, the use of bioinformatics strategies to analyse high-dimensional data has provided unprecedented insights into the molecular basis of disease. In addition to the identification of disease subtypes — which enables risk stratification — informatics analysis has facilitated the identification of novel risk factors and drivers of disease, biomarkers of progression and treatment response, as well as possibilities for drug repurposing or repositioning; moreover, bioinformatics has guided research towards precision and personalized medicine. Implementation of specific computational approaches such as artificial intelligence, machine learning and molecular subtyping has yet to become widespread in urology clinical practice for reasons of cost, disruption of clinical workflow and need for prospective validation of informatics approaches in independent patient cohorts. Solving these challenges might accelerate routine integration of bioinformatics into clinical settings.",Bioinformatics,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1038/s41585-023-00805-3,1
"BackgroundImplementation of clinical metagenomics and pathogen genomic surveillance can be particularly challenging due to the lack of bioinformatics tools and/or expertise. In order to face this challenge, we have previously developed INSaFLU, a free web-based bioinformatics platform for virus next-generation sequencing data analysis. Here, we considerably expanded its genomic surveillance component and developed a new module (TELEVIR) for metagenomic virus identification.ResultsThe routine genomic surveillance component was strengthened with new workflows and functionalities, including (i) a reference-based genome assembly pipeline for Oxford Nanopore technologies (ONT) data; (ii) automated SARS-CoV-2 lineage classification; (iii) Nextclade analysis; (iv) Nextstrain phylogeographic and temporal analysis (SARS-CoV-2, human and avian influenza, monkeypox, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV A/B), as well as a “generic” build for other viruses); and (v)algn2phenofor screening mutations of interest. Both INSaFLU pipelines for reference-based consensus generation (Illumina and ONT) were benchmarked against commonly used command line bioinformatics workflows for SARS-CoV-2, and an INSaFLU snakemake version was released. In parallel, a new module (TELEVIR) for virus detection was developed, after extensive benchmarking of state-of-the-art metagenomics software and following up-to-date recommendations and practices in the field. TELEVIR allows running complex workflows, covering several combinations of steps (e.g., with/without viral enrichment or host depletion), classification software (e.g., Kaiju, Kraken2, Centrifuge, FastViromeExplorer), and databases (RefSeq viral genome, Virosaurus, etc.), while culminating in user- and diagnosis-oriented reports. Finally, to potentiate real-time virus detection during ONT runs, we developedfindONTime, a tool aimed at reducing costs and the time between sample reception and diagnosis.ConclusionsThe accessibility, versatility, and functionality of INSaFLU-TELEVIR are expected to supply public and animal health laboratories and researchers with a user-oriented and pan-viral bioinformatics framework that promotes a strengthened and timely viral metagenomic detection and routine genomics surveillance. INSaFLU-TELEVIR is compatible with Illumina, Ion Torrent, and ONT data and is freely available athttps://insaflu.insa.pt/(online tool) andhttps://github.com/INSaFLU(code).",Bioinformatics,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s13073-024-01334-3,1
"Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease characterized by intestinal inflammation and autoimmune responses. This study aimed to identify diagnostic biomarkers for UC through bioinformatics analysis and machine learning, and to validate these findings through immunofluorescence staining of clinical samples. Differential expression analysis was conducted on expression profile datasets from 4 UC samples. Key biomarkers were selected using LASSO logistic regression, SVM-RFE, and Random Forest algorithms. The diagnostic performance of these biomarkers was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. Functional enrichment analysis assessed the biological functions of these biomarkers. The CIBERSORT algorithm was used to analyze immune cell infiltration. Regulatory networks for diagnostic markers were constructed. Additionally, immunofluorescence staining was performed on clinical samples to validate the expression levels of key biomarkers. Differential analysis identified 199 significantly differentially expressed genes. SLC6A14 was selected as a key diagnostic biomarker, demonstrating excellent diagnostic performance in training and validation sets (AUC values: 0.973, 0.984, and 0.970). Immune cell infiltration analysis revealed significant increases in Neutrophils and activated Mast cells in UC samples, whereas resting Mast cells were relatively downregulated. Furthermore, SLC6A14 showed strong correlations with various immune cells. The ceRNA network identified 22 lncRNAs and 10 miRNAs associated with SLC6A14. Immunofluorescence staining of clinical samples confirmed that SLC6A14 expression is significantly higher in UC patients compared to normal intestinal mucosa, and its expression increases with UC activity. SLC6A14 has been confirmed as a key diagnostic marker for UC, validated both through bioinformatics analysis and immunofluorescence staining of clinical samples. It maintains regulatory relationships with various non-coding RNAs and plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of UC through its interactions with immune cells.",Bioinformatics,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10528-025-11027-0,1
"Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a complex endocrine disorder with an unclear epigenetic basis. This study sought to identify critical methylation regulators implicated in PCOS progression and evaluate their therapeutic potential through comprehensive experimental validation. Bioinformatics analysis was performed to screen differentially expressed genes (DEGs) associated with PCOS and methylation regulators from public databases. Intersection analysis revealed PRDM6 as a key methylation regulator among 177 PCOS-related DEGs and 175 known methylation regulators. Further in silico prediction identified 16 PRDM6-correlated DEGs harboring potential post-translational modification (PTM) sites, with functional enrichment analysis linking them to the cAMP signaling pathway, notably involving RAC3, FXYD1, and SSTR2. To validate these findings, we established in vivo PCOS models using dehydroepiandrosterone-induced rats and in vitro models to mimic PCOS-associated insulin resistance using insulin-induced granulosa cells. In the rodent model, PRDM6 expression was significantly downregulated, while lentivirus-mediated PRDM6 overexpression restored serum sex hormone levels (measured by ELISA) and ameliorated ovarian histopathological abnormalities (assessed via hematoxylin-eosin staining). In vitro, PRDM6 upregulation in granulosa cells attenuated insulin-induced hyperproliferation (evaluated by CCK-8 and EdU assays) and suppressed pro-inflammatory responses (quantified by ELISA). Collectively, these results demonstrated that PRDM6 serves as a pivotal methylation regulator in PCOS pathogenesis, with therapeutic relevance in mitigating hormonal dysregulation, ovarian dysfunction, aberrant granulosa cell proliferation, and inflammation. This study provides novel insights into the epigenetic mechanisms underlying PCOS and highlights PRDM6 as a potential therapeutic target.",Bioinformatics,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s43032-025-01994-5,1
"BackgroundCervical cancer has extremely high morbidity and mortality, and its pathogenesis is still in the exploratory stage. This study aimed to screen and identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) related to cervical cancer through bioinformatics analysis.MethodsGSE63514 and GSE67522 were selected from the GEO database to screen DEGs. Then GO and KEGG analysis were performed on DEGs. PPI network of DEGs was constructed through STRING website, and the hub genes were found through 12 algorithms of Cytoscape software. Meanwhile, GSE30656 was selected from the GEO database to screen DEMs. Target genes of DEMs were screened through TagetScan, miRTarBase and miRDB.

The expression of these hub genes were verified through TCGA, GEPIA, qRT-PCR, and immunohistochemistry.ResultsSix hub genes,TOP2A,AURKA,CCNA2,IVL,KRT1, andIGFBP5, were mined through the protein-protein interaction network. The expression of these hub genes were verified through TCGA, GEPIA, qRT-PCR, and immunohistochemistry, and it was found thatTOP2A,AURKAas well asCCNA2 were overexpressed andIGFBP5was low expression in cervical cancer.ConclusionsThis study showed thatTOP2A,AURKA,CCNA2 andIGFBP5screened through bioinformatics analysis were significantly differentially expressed in cervical cancer samples compared with normal samples, which might be biomarkers of cervical cancer.",Bioinformatics,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12885-024-12658-z,1
"This study aims to screen for common differentially expressed genes (DEGs) related to Parkinson’s disease (PD) and circadian rhythm (CR) through bioinformatics methods, and further analyze their potential molecular mechanisms and traditional Chinese medicine-targeted components, providing new targets and drug development ideas for the treatment of PD. This study first obtained PD-related microarray data from the GEO database to screen for differentially expressed genes. Using the WGCNA algorithm to construct a gene co-expression network and filter key module genes. Combine GeneCards and Msigdb databases to obtain CR-related genes, and use the Venny2.1 tool to screen for common DEGs between PD and CR. Further, the String database and Cytoscape software were used to construct a protein-protein interaction network, and the DAVID platform was utilized for KEGG and GO enrichment analysis. Using the Cytohubba plugin to screen hub genes and evaluate their diagnostic value with ROC curves. In addition, the mRNA-miRNA regulatory network was constructed using the Mirwalk database, and potential targeted traditional Chinese medicines and their core components were predicted using the Coremine and HERB databases. Finally, molecular docking was used to verify the binding activity of key components with the targets. This study identified a total of 659 PD-related DEGs and 2555 CR-related genes. Through WGCNA analysis, 3586 key module genes were obtained, and finally, 62 common key genes for PD and CR were screened and a PPI network was constructed. GO and KEGG enrichment analyses showed that these genes are mainly enriched in biological processes such as dopamine biosynthesis and neurodegenerative disease pathways. Through Cytohubba, two hub genes, SNCA and DRD2, were identified, and their expression levels were significantly lower in the PD group compared to the control group. ROC curve analysis showed that DRD2 and SNCA had high diagnostic value (AUC of 0.87 and 0.80, respectively). The further constructed mRNA-miRNA network shows that SNCA and DRD2 are associated with 669 and 404 miRNAs, respectively, and there are 143 common miRNAs. Three core traditional Chinese medicines (Gastrodia Elata, Malt, Papaya) and their five core components (ent-Epicatechin, HMF, Protocatechuic Acid, Succinic Acid, and Vanillin) were screened through the Coremine database and the HERB database. The molecular docking results show that ent-Epicatechin, vanillin, and protocatechuic acid have binding energies with the target protein below − 5.5 kcal/mol, indicating stable binding. This study identified the hub genes SNCA and DRD2 related to PD and CR through bioinformatics analysis, revealing their potential molecular mechanisms and targeted traditional Chinese medicine components.

"Atherosclerosis (AS) is the leading cause of coronary heart disease, which is the primary cause of death worldwide. Recent studies have identified disulfidptosis as a new type of cell death that may be involved in onset and development of many diseases. However, the role of disulfidptosis in AS is not clear. In this study, bioinformatics analysis and experiments in vivo and in vitro were performed to evaluate the potential relationship between disulfidptosis and AS. AS-related sequencing data were obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). Bioinformatics techniques were used to evaluate differentially expressed genes (DEGs) associated with disulfidptosis-related AS. Hub genes were screened using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and random forests (RF) methods. In addition, we established a foam cell model in vitro and an AS mouse model in vivo to verify the expressions of hub genes. In addition, we constructed a diagnostic nomogram with hub genes to predict progression of AS. Finally, the consensus clustering method was used to establish two different subtypes, and associations between subtypes and immunity were explored. As the results, 9 disulfidptosis-related AS DEGs were identified from GSE28829 and GSE43292 datasets. Evaluation of DEGs using LASSO and RF methods resulted in identification of 4 hub genes (CAPZB,DSTN,MYL6,PDLIM1), which were analyzed for diagnostic value using ROC curve analysis and verified in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, a nomogram including hub genes was established that accurately predicted the occurrence of AS. The consensus clustering algorithm was used to separate patients with early atherosclerotic plaques and patients with advanced atherosclerotic plaques into two disulfidptosis subtypes. Cluster B displayed higher levels of infiltrating immune cells, which indicated that patients in cluster B may have a positive immune response for progression of AS. In summary, disulfidptosis-related genes includingCAPZB,DSTN,MYL6, andPDLIM1may be diagnostic markers and therapeutic targets for AS. In addition, these genes are closely related to immune cells, which may inform immunotherapy for AS.",Bioinformatics,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1038/s41598-024-78392-5,1
"Diabetes mellitus (DM), the ninth leading cause of death worldwide, is characterized by a relative or absolute deficiency of insulin, leading to increased production of advanced glycosylation end-products (AGEs), which further enhances oxidative and nitrosative stress, often leading to a variety of macrovascular and microvascular complications, such as diabetic nephropathy (DN), retinopathy, and neuropathy. Especially, diabetic patients with end stage renal disease (ESRD) usually have concomitant severe peripheral arterial disease. Unfortunately, there is still no effective therapeutic treatment for DM patients combined with DN and diabetic foot ulcer (DFU). Thus, we performed a series of bioinformatics analyses to investigated the molecular mechanisms involved in the occurrence of these two complications. We screened for differentially expressed genes (DEGs) from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database, namely GSE96804 and GSE134431, and conducted enrichment and protein-protein interaction analyses. Subsequently, we constructed animal models of these two diseases in vivo, and validated the predictions’ accuracy using quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) experiments to confirm the expression levels of mRNA. Finally, we conducted protein-chemical interactions and drug prediction. We identified 104 DEGs, with many of them being involved in inflammation or lipid metabolism. We obtained 7 hub genes closely related to DN and DFU, and verified through animal experiments that the expression trends of 5 of them (NID2,LUM,ECM,LTBP1andLRRC2) were consistent with the results of bioinformatics analysis. Notably, our study showed that sex hormones including pirinixic acid, testosterone enanthate, and progesterone were predicted to be the most promising drugs, with the combined score of the three being the highest. This finding may potentially provide common therapeutic targets for DN and DFU. Additionally, it is important to understand these networks and hub genes to advance our understanding of the multifaceted complications of DM and the future development of drugs to treat these complications.",Bioinformatics,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11033-025-11350-0,1
"Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), the seventh most common cancer worldwide, has become more closely linked to poor lifestyle habits. Despite improvements in cancer treatment approaches, patients with stage I–II HNSCC have a 70–90% 5-year survival rate, and for patients with advanced stages III-IV, this rate falls to about 40%. This controversy is all about the heterogeneity of HNSCC. Finding diagnosis and prognosis biomarkers has the potential to make significant improvements in the life expectancy and overall health of these patients. The combination of bioinformatics and machine learning has facilitated the finding of the best markers for HNSCC. In this regard, RNA expression data were obtained to identify genes that were expressed differently (DEGs) and utilize a deep learning algorithm to identify genes that exhibited significant variability. In addition, correlations between clinical data and DEGs, the building of a Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve, and the prediction of tumor-infiltrating immune cells were analyzed. Deep learning analysis identified diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers strongly associated with carcinogenesis, such as KRT33B, KRTAP3-3, C14orf34, and ACADM. In addition, after analyzing the ROC curve, it was found that the combination of ACADM, KRT33B, and C14orf34 is the most practical combination of diagnostic markers. This combination achieved sensitivity, specificity, and Area Under the Curve (AUC) values of 0.92, 0.86, and 0.93, respectively.",Bioinformatics,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13353-025-01018-7,1
"BackgroundProstate cancer (PCa) represents one of the most frequently diagnosed malignancies in men worldwide, with a high incidence and mortality rate. Although significant advances have been made in early detection, therapeutic strategies for advanced and metastatic PCa remain limited. The lack of reliable biomarkers and effective targeted therapies poses a critical challenge in clinical management. This study aims to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying PCa progression, focusing on identifying novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets through an integrative bioinformatics approach.MethodsWe performed a comprehensive analysis of publicly available gene expression datasets (GEO and TCGA) to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) associated with PCa. Using advanced computational techniques such as weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), Lasso regression, and random forest algorithms, we pinpointed key genes involved in tumorigenesis. Further, molecular docking was employed to screen for small molecules that interact with these identified genes, followed by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to evaluate the stability and binding affinity of the most promising compounds.ResultsOur bioinformatics analysis revealed Hepsin (HPN) as a core gene strongly associated with PCa. We observed that HPN is closely linked to immune evasion mechanisms in the tumor microenvironment, where its expression correlates with altered immune cell infiltration, particularly T cells and macrophages. In silico screening identified Bentiromide as a potent small molecule that binds to HPN with high affinity. Molecular dynamics simulations confirmed the stability of the HPN-Bentiromide complex, showing strong non-covalent interactions, including van der Waals and electrostatic forces. The binding energy analysis further validated the potential of Bentiromide as a therapeutic candidate for PCa.ConclusionThis study provides valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms of PCa, identifying HPN as a pivotal gene in cancer progression and immune evasion. We demonstrate the potential of HPN as a novel biomarker and therapeutic target for PCa. Moreover, Bentiromide emerges as a promising candidate for targeted therapy, with implications not only for PCa treatment but also for other malignancies involving immune escape mechanisms.

"Visceral obesity (VO), characterized by excess fat around internal organs, is a recognized risk factor for gynecological tumors, including benign uterine leiomyoma (ULM) and malignant uterine leiomyosarcoma (ULS). Despite this association, the shared molecular mechanisms remain underexplored. This study utilizes an integrated bioinformatics approach to elucidate common molecular pathways and identify potential therapeutic targets linking VO, ULM, and ULS. We analyzed gene expression datasets from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in each condition. We found 101, 145, and 18 DEGs in VO, ULM, and ULS, respectively, with 37 genes overlapping across all three conditions. Functional enrichment analysis revealed that these overlapping DEGs were significantly enriched in pathways related to cell proliferation, immune response, and transcriptional regulation, suggesting shared biological processes. Protein–protein interaction network analysis identified 14 hub genes, of which TOP2A, APOE, and TYMS showed significant differential expression across all three conditions. Drug-gene interaction analysis identified 26 FDA-approved drugs targeting these hub genes, highlighting potential therapeutic opportunities.

"ObjectivesIKZF1 is a key regulator of lymphocyte differentiation, and its alterations are associated with increased risk and poor outcomes in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). This study examines the association ofIKZF1rs4132601 polymorphism and Δ4–7 somatic deletion with the susceptibility to ALL while also analyzing their molecular implications through bioinformatics.MethodsThis case-control study was conducted on 58 pediatric patients diagnosed with ALL and 150 healthy controls. Genotyping for theIKZF1rs4132601 variant was performed by PCR followed by sequencing, while the Δ4–7 deletions were identified using multiplex PCR. Bioinformatics analyses were used to calculate the difference in free energy of hybridization for each wild-type vs. the variant allele and analyze potential disruptions in putative miRNA-binding sites ofIKZF13’UTR and changes in RNA secondary structure.ResultsThe presence of the rs4132601 G allele was significantly associated with a reduced risk of ALL development [OR(95%ci), 0.36(0.19,0.69)], and a strong association with the Δ4–7 deletion was noted [RR(95%ci), 8.33(1.57–10.69)]. The rs4132601 polymorphism disrupts miRNA binding sites, particularly miR-1261, miR-524-3p, and miR-525-3p, potentially impairing post-transcriptional control ofIKZF1. Bioinformatics analyses further indicate that the G allele stabilizes the RNA secondary structure, which hinders normal IKZF1post-transcriptional regulation and promotes leukemogenesis.DiscussionOur study underscores the association between the rs4132601 polymorphism and Δ4–7 deletion and heightened risk of pediatric ALL. We favor the notion that the rs4132601G allele contributes to leukemogenesis by affecting miRNA-mediated regulation and RNA structural stability. These findings support the potential ofIKZF1-targeted, miRNA-based therapies in pediatric ALL.",Bioinformatics,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11033-025-10608-x,1
"Breast, ovarian, lung, cervical, and colorectal cancers are among the most prevalent malignancies affecting women worldwide. This study aimed to elucidate the common molecular mechanisms of tumorigenesis and identify potential biomarkers using an integrative bioinformatics and network-based approach. Integrative profiling of five microarray datasets identified 66 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) that are common across five cancer types. Gene ontology and KEGG pathway analyses of common DEGs were performed using the DAVID database. The cell cycle processes were the most enriched functions, and oocyte meiosis, oocyte maturation, the p53 signaling pathway, cancer pathways, and cellular senescence were the most important pathways identified. Protein–protein interaction (PPI) networks for the DEGs were constructed using the STRING database, and the resulting networks were visualized in Cytoscape. Through PPI network analysis, ten hub genes were identified, and subsequent survival analysis confirmed that CHEK1, DLGAP5, CCNB2, and CCNA2 are significantly associated with poor patient survivability, establishing them as common biomarkers across multiple cancer types. Subsequently, ten transcription factors (TFs) and ten post-transcriptional regulators were identified through the assessment of regulatory networks involving TFs-DEGs and miRNAs-DEGs.

"Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a complex autoimmune disorder characterized by immune dysregulation and multi-organ involvement. This study focuses on the dysregulated expression of lncRNAs SNHG15 and OTUD6B-AS1 as potential biomarkers for disease progression and diagnostics. A comprehensive bioinformatics analysis of RNA-sequencing data from PBMCs of SLE patients and healthy controls identified differentially expressed lncRNAs, miRNAs, and mRNAs. The DAVID tool was employed for functional enrichment analyses to elucidate the biological pathways and functions associated with these differentially expressed genes. Concurrently, the STRING database was used to predict protein–protein interactions, enhancing our understanding of the molecular interactions and networks involved. Additionally, the relationships between lncRNAs, miRNAs, and mRNAs were explored through the construction of a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) network, visualized using Cytoscape. The findings from the bioinformatics analysis were substantiated by qPCR, which validated the differential expression of the lncRNAs SNHG15 and OTUD6B-AS1 in a larger cohort of samples, affirming their potential roles as biomarkers for SLE. The findings revealed significant up-regulation of SNHG15 (fold change = 2.01,p= 0.0011) and down-regulation of OTUD6B-AS1 (fold change = 0.26,p< 0.0001) in SLE patients compared to controls. Correlation analyses linked OTUD6B-AS1 expression with hematological and inflammatory markers, while SNHG15 was associated with liver function indicators. ROC analysis demonstrated high diagnostic accuracy for both lncRNAs, particularly OTUD6B-AS1. This study establishes SNHG15 and OTUD6B-AS1 as promising biomarkers for SLE, highlighting their distinct associations with immune and organ-specific pathology. The robust diagnostic performance of OTUD6B-AS1, evidenced by its high sensitivity and specificity, suggests its utility in developing more accurate diagnostic tests for SLE. Furthermore, the correlation of these lncRNAs with disease activity markers underscores their potential role in monitoring disease progression and severity in SLE patients.",Bioinformatics,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10528-025-11116-0,1
"An increasing number of research have suggested that ferroptosis plays an important role in endometriosis (EMS). This study was to identify a ferroptosis-related diagnosis gene in EMS by using bioinformatics. R Bioconductor package limma was used to analyzed the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the EMS groups and control groups. CIBERSORT was used to analyze the differences between the EMS group and control group of 22 immune cells. Quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR) and Western blot (WB) were used to validate the expression level of FZD7 in tissue samples. The study found that FZD7 was upregulated and showed good diagnostic value in five EMS transcriptome databases. RT-qPCR and WB experiments also verified that FZD7 was upregulated in EMS. Moreover, we found that macrophages, especially M2 macrophages, were significantly infiltrated in EMS. FZD7 was positively correlated with M2 macrophage infiltration, and was up-regulated in the endometrial stromal cells co-cultured with macrophages.

"Prior coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) transcriptomic studies using diverse methods for differential gene expression (DGE) profiling of specific samples yielded inconsistent results. To validate the shared molecular patterns of COVID-19 across cell, tissue, and systemic levels, we conducted a systematic rank combination meta-analysis of differentially expressed gene (DEG) profiles sourced from various sample types using a standardised bioinformatics pipeline consisting of DESeq2, RankProd, and weighted gene correlation network analysis (WGCNA). Consistently upregulated ISGs (including key hub geneIFIT2), compared with interleukins were identified in swab samples, reflecting dominant innate immune responses at the viral entry point. Blood samples revealed diverse gene functions in immune and neurological regulation, highlighting the complex interplay of systemic regulation. Significant enrichment of immunoglobulin-related and extracellular matrix genes indicates their role in the host adaptive immunity and long-term host responses in tissue samples.

"PurposeAge-related cataract (ARC) remains one of the leading causes of blindness globally. Despite the satisfactory outcomes of surgical interventions, significant disparities in access to medical care prevent many patients from receiving effective treatment. Thus, identifying reliable biomarkers and therapeutic targets to expand treatment options for ARC is essential. Recent evidence indicates that microRNAs (miRNAs) play a role in the development of cataracts and may serve as promising biomarkers. Consequently, this study aims to investigate miRNAs’ levels and potential functions in ARC.MethodsWe conducted a meta-analysis following the PRISMA guidelines by searching three databases from inception to March 31, 2023. The quality of the articles was assessed using the NOS. Subsequently, the targets of the miRNAs identified in the meta-analysis were predicted using six databases, and their GO functions and KEGG pathway enrichment information were analyzed via DAVID.ResultsAn initial search yielded 225 publications, from which 22 miRNAs across 37 studies were selected for our meta-analysis. We identified eight differentially expressed miRNAs (DEmiRNAs) in ARC, comprising two up-regulated miRNAs (miR-124 and miR-125a) and six down-regulated miRNAs (miR-15a, miR-23b, miR-34a, miR-221, miR-222, and miR-378a). A total of 972 targets for these miRNAs have been confirmed, and subsequent bioinformatics analysis has revealed their potential functions and pathways in various ARC-related processes.ConclusionsThis study indicates that eight differentially expressed miRNAs (miRNA-15a, miRNA-23b, miRNA-34a, miRNA-124, miRNA-125a, miRNA-221, miRNA-222, and miRNA-378a) may serve as biomarkers for ARC. Bioinformatics analyses suggest varied potential roles for each miRNA, providing a framework for future research in ARC. This systematic evaluation represents the initial depiction of the miRNA-biomarker landscape in ARC.Key MessagesWhat is knownMicroRNAs(miRNAs) could serve as biomarkers for age-related cataract(ARC) since their abundances are associated with ARC and can play a role in cataractogenesis. However, existing studies have reported inconsistent results regarding the miRNA level in ARC. Therefore, achieving a consensus on the role of miRNAs in ARC is essential to clarify their involvement.What is newThis study suggested that eight differentially expressed miRNAs (miRNA-15a, miRNA-23b, miRNA-34a, miRNA-124, miRNA-125a, miRNA-221, miRNA-222, and miRNA-378a) may serve as biomarkers for ARC.Our bioinformatics analysis identified various potential roles for each miRNA, which could guide future research on ARC.",Bioinformatics,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00417-024-06723-3,1
"BackgroundLower-grade glioma (LGG) is a common primary brain tumor with potential progression to glioblastoma. Its development is closely linked to DNA damage repair. DNA polymerase delta subunit 3 (POLD3), a subunit of the DNA polymerase δ complex, participates in DNA replication and repair. POLD3 may act as a therapeutic target and prognostic biomarker in LGG.MethodsWe collected primary data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), the Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas (CGGA), the Tumor Immune Estimation Resource (TIMER), and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA). The CGGA dataset included messenger RNA (mRNA) sequencing and clinical data from 403 LGG cases; its microarray subset contained 142 additional cases. The TCGA dataset provided clinical data for 503 LGG cases. Employing bioinformatics tools, we investigated the correlation of POLD3 expression with the clinical characteristics, pathological features, survival outcomes, and tumor immune microenvironment in LGG. Subsequent functional validation of POLD3’s impact in LGG was performed using both cellular and animal models.ResultsIntegrative analysis combining bioinformatics and experimental approaches revealed significant POLD3 overexpression in LGG. Elevated POLD3 levels exhibited significant associations with distinct clinicopathological features, altered immune cell infiltration profiles, and adverse clinical outcomes. Functionally, POLD3 was demonstrated to drive LGG cell proliferation, invasion, and modulate the tumor microenvironment.ConclusionThis study establishes POLD3 as a critical molecular determinant in LGG pathogenesis. Our findings position POLD3 as a promising multifaceted target, with significant implications for advancing LGG diagnostics, therapeutic development, immune modulation strategies, and prognostic assessment, thereby providing a fresh conceptual framework for understanding and managing this tumor.",Bioinformatics,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12885-025-14934-y,1
"BackgroundHeart failure (HF) is a common clinical syndrome caused by ventricular dysfunction and one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide. Previous studies have suggested that anoikis is relevant to HF. This study aimed to identify hub genes associated with anoikis that may offer therapeutic targets for HF.Materials and methodsGene expression data for GSE36074 were obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and anoikis-related genes (ARGs) were extracted from GeneCards. GEO2R was used to screen for differentially expressed genes (DEGs), then by overlapping DEGs with ARGs, differentially expressed ARGs (DEARGs) were screened. The biological functions of the DEARGs were determined using DAVID. Subsequently, two machine learning (ML) algorithms were employed to identify hub DEARGs: least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and random forest (RF). In addition, miRNA-hub DEARGs and drug-hub DEARGs networks were constructed. Lastly, the hub DEARGs were validated by quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR) and Immunofluorescence (IF).ResultsA total of 138 DEARGs were identified in GSE36074. Functional analysis of DEARGs revealed that they were primarily enriched in the positive regulation of the apoptotic process, PI3K-Akt, and FoxO signaling pathways. Subsequently, two hub DEARGs (Tln1 and TGFβ2) were screened using LASSO and RF algorithms. According to the miRNA–hub DEARGs networks, Tln1 and TGFβ2 were regulated by 34 and 68 miRNAs, respectively. Moreover, drug-hub DEARGs networks showed that Gemogenovatucel-t, Lerdelimumab, Belagenpumatucel-l, Fresolimumab, Bintrafusp alfa, Trabedersen and Luspatercept-aamt are potential drugs that could target TGFβ2. Finally, RT-qPCR and IF validation of two key DEARGs (Tln1 and TGFβ2) supported our bioinformatics analysis.ConclusionsThese findings suggest that Tln1 and TGFβ2 may play important roles in HF development through the regulation of anoikis and may serve as therapeutic targets for HF.Clinical trial numberNot applicable.",Bioinformatics,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s41065-025-00532-2,1
"Coronary heart disease (CHD), is a complex cardiovascular disease driven by atherosclerosis, resulting from a dynamic interplay between dysregulated lipid metabolism and chronic inflammation. This study integrates bioinformatics analysis of GEO datasets with experimental validation to dissect molecular mechanisms underlying CHD pathogenesis. A total of 487 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified (including 295 upregulated and 192 downregulated), with hub genes such asCD36,ALDH2,TNF-α, andIL1Bhighlighted in lipid handling, oxidative stress, and pro-inflammatory cascades. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) revealed aberrant activation of lipid metabolism-related modules in CHD patients. KEGG enrichment highlighted their involvement in fatty acid transport, cholesterol homeostasis, NF-κB, and the IL-17 signaling. LASSO regression, applied to the combined datasets, identified SERPINA1, and GLUL as diagnostic biomarkers, with in vitro models supporting their pro-atherogenic roles in oxLDL-induced endothelial injury. Animal experiments further validated these findings: CHD rat models exhibited marked upregulation of SERPINA1, and GLUL in myocardial tissue, paralleled by increased M1 macrophage infiltration. Together, this study delineates the intricate lipid-immune axis in CHD and proposes novel candidate biomarkers and therapeutic targets, underscoring their potential for advancing precision medicine in CHD.",Bioinformatics,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s41065-025-00603-4,1
"BackgroundThe human gut microbiome has emerged as a potential modulator of treatment efficacy for different cancers, including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients undergoing immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy. In this study, we investigated the association of gut microbial variations with response against ICIs by analyzing the gut metagenomes of NSCLC patients.MethodsStrain identification from the publicly available metagenomes of 87 NSCLC patients, treated with nivolumab and collected at three different timepoints (T0, T1, and T2), was performed using StrainPhlAn3. Variant calling and annotations were performed using Snippy and associations between microbial genes and genomic variations with treatment responses were evaluated using MaAsLin2. Supervised machine learning models were developed to prioritize single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) predictive of treatment response. Structural bioinformatics approaches were employed using MUpro, I-Mutant 2.0, CASTp and PyMOL to access the functional impact of prioritized SNPs on protein stability and active site interactions.ResultsOur findings revealed the presence of strains for several microbial species (e.g.,Lachnospira eligens) exclusively in Responders (R) or Non-responders (NR) (e.g.,Parabacteroides distasonis). Variant calling and annotations for the identified strains from R and NR patients highlighted variations in genes (e.g.,ftsA,lpdA, andnadB) that were significantly associated with the NR status of patients. Among the developed models, Logistic Regression performed best (accuracy > 90% and AUC ROC > 95%) in prioritizing SNPs in genes that could distinguish R and NR at T0. These SNPs included Ala168Val (lpdA) inPhocaeicola doreiand Tyr233His (lpdA), Leu330Ser (lpdA), and His233Arg (obgE) inParabacteroides distasonis. Lastly, structural analyses of these prioritized variants inobjEandlpdArevealed their involvement in the substrate binding site and an overall reduction in protein stability. This suggests that these variations might likely disrupt substrate interactions and compromise protein stability, thereby impairing normal protein functionality.ConclusionThe integration of metagenomics, machine learning, and structural bioinformatics provides a robust framework for understanding the association between gut microbial variations and treatment response, paving the way for personalized therapies for NSCLC in the future. These findings emphasize the potential clinical implications of microbiome-based biomarkers in guiding patient-specific treatment strategies and improving immunotherapy outcomes.",Bioinformatics,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12967-025-06370-0,1
"IntroductionPreeclampsia (PE) is a severe pregnancy complication with limited early diagnostic and therapeutic options. Ferroptosis, an iron-dependent cell death pathway, has emerged as a potential mechanism in PE pathogenesis. This study investigated ferroptosis-related genes (FRGs) in PE to identify diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets.MethodsDifferentially expressed genes were identified from GEO databases and intersected with FRGs. Hub genes were selected using RandomForest and LASSO algorithms. Their diagnostic potential was evaluated through ROC analysis. Regulatory networks were constructed using transcription factors, microRNAs and potential drug targets. Hub gene expression was validated through immunohistochemistry, Western blot, and RT-qPCR in placental tissues and hypoxic trophoblasts.ResultsWe identified 25 ferroptosis-related differentially expressed genes enriched in ferroptosis and HIF-1 pathways. Four hub genes (NDRG1, P4HA1, LDHA, and IDO1) showed high diagnostic efficiency (AUC=0.9182). Immune cell analysis revealed altered levels of plasma cells, CD8+ T cells, Tregs, monocytes, and M2 macrophages in PE, correlating significantly with hub gene expression. We identified 84 mRNA-miRNA and 119 mRNA-TF interactions. Among 19 potential drugs, Tetrahydro-NAD showed promising targeting potential. Experimental validation confirmed elevated expression of NDRG1, P4HA1, and LDHA, and decreased IDO1 in PE tissues and hypoxic conditions.DiscussionThis study identified four FRGs as potential PE biomarkers and therapeutic targets, providing new insights into PE pathogenesis through integrated bioinformatics and experimental validation.

"The most widespread primary liver cancer around the world is hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and its rising incidence and mortality rates are major challenges for public health. This study investigates the role of glucocorticoids in HCC, focusing on their associated phenotypic genes and their impact on patient prognosis. Utilizing comprehensive bioinformatics approaches, a total of 751 differentially expressed genes were identified, with 470 showing increased expression and 281 showing decreased expression in tumor samples. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) indicated that tumor samples showed significant enrichment in spliceosome, ribosome, and DNA replication pathways, while control samples were enriched in complement and coagulation cascades and drug metabolism pathways. Furthermore, based on glucocorticoid-related genes, consensus clustering categorized HCC samples into two subtypes, with subtype 2 exhibiting poorer prognosis. Immune infiltration analysis indicated significant differences in various immune cell types between the two subtypes, suggesting potential immune evasion mechanisms. Drug sensitivity analysis from the Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer (GDSC) database revealed that subtype 2 patients may be more responsive to certain drugs, such as Bortezomib and Dactinomycin. Furthermore, based on the established prognostic model, a total of four genes (KIF2C, CYP2C9, PON1, SPP1) were identified. These genes are both glucocorticoid-related receptors and closely associated with the development of hepatocellular carcinoma, and they have reliable diagnostic and prognostic value. DGIdb drug prediction shows that a variety of drugs and compounds can target these four genes. Finally, immunohistochemistry revealed that in contrast to normal liver tissues, KIF2C and SPP1 were highly expressed in tumor tissues, while CYP2C9 and PON1 were expressed at lower levels in tumor tissues. This study highlights the importance of glucocorticoid-related genes in the development and prognosis of HCC, providing insights for future experimental validation and clinical applications.",Bioinformatics,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1038/s41598-025-12839-1,1
"Based on bioinformatics and machine learning methods, we conducted a study to screen the core genes of minimal change disease (MCD) and further explore its pathogenesis. First, we obtained the chip data sets GSE108113 and GSE200828 from the Gene Expression Comprehensive Database (GEO), which contained MCD information. We then used R software to analyze the gene chip data and performed functional enrichment analysis. Subsequently, we employed Cytoscape to screen the core genes and utilized machine learning algorithms (random forest and LASSO regression) to accurately identify them. To validate and analyze the core genes, we conducted immunohistochemistry (IHC) and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA). Our results revealed a total of 394 highly expressed differential genes. Enrichment analysis indicated that these genes are primarily involved inTcell differentiation and p13k-akt signaling pathway of immune response. We identified NOTCH1, TP53, GATA3, and TGF-β1 as the core genes. IHC staining demonstrated significant differences in the expression of these four core genes between the normal group and the MCD group. Furthermore, GSEA suggested that their up-regulation may be closely associated with the pathological changes in MCD kidneys, particularly in the glycosaminoglycans signaling pathway. In conclusion, our study highlights NOTCH1, TP53, GATA3, and TGF-β1 as the core genes in MCD and emphasizes the close relationship between glycosaminoglycans and pathogenesis of MCD.",Bioinformatics,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11255-024-04226-y,1
"BackgroundWRKY proteins are important transcription factors (TFs) in plants, involved in growth and development and responses to environmental changes. Although WRKY TFs have been studied at the genome level inArachisgenus, including oil crop and turfgrass, their regulatory networks in controlling flowering time remain unclear. The aim of this study was to predict the molecular mechanisms of WRKY TFs regulation flowering time inArachisgenus at the genome level using bioinformatics approaches.ResultsThe flowering-time genes ofArachisgenus were retrieved from the flowering-time gene database. The regulatory networks between WRKY TFs and downstream genes inArachisgenus were predicted using bioinformatics tools. The results showed that WRKY TFs were involved in aging, autonomous, circadian clock, hormone, photoperiod, sugar, temperature, and vernalization pathways to modulate flowering time inArachis duranensis,Arachis ipaensis,Arachis monticola, andArachis hypogaeacv. Tifrunner. The WRKY TF binding sites in homologous flowering-time genes exhibited asymmetric evolutionary pattern, indicating that the WRKY TFs interact with other transcription factors to modulate flowering time in the fourArachisspecies. Protein interaction network analysis showed that WRKY TFs interacted with FRUITFULL and APETALA2 to modulate flowering time in the fourArachisspecies. WRKY TFs implicated in regulating flowering time had low expression levels, whereas their interaction proteins had varying expression patterns in 22 tissues ofA. hypogaeacv. Tifrunner. These results indicate that WRKY TFs exhibit antagonistic or synergistic interactions with the associated proteins.ConclusionsThis study reveals complex regulatory networks through which WRKY TFs modulate flowering time in the fourArachisspecies using bioinformatics approaches.",Bioinformatics,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12870-024-05343-7,1
"BackgroundNext-generation sequencing (NGS)-based testing is a cost-effective method for identifying pathogenic germline genetic variations in cancer-predisposing genes in hereditary breast cancer. However, many of the variants detected through NGS are classified as variants of uncertain significance (VUS), where the impact of the variants on protein function remains unclear. Bioinformatics analysis using multiple computational tools is postulated to aid in generating new knowledge regarding the functional relevance of these VUS. This study aimed to gain new insights into the potential pathogenicity of a selected set of VUS identified in a cohort of Sri Lankan hereditary breast cancer patients using advanced bioinformatics tools.MethodsThe cancer database at the Centre for Genetics and Genomics contains genomic and clinical data from patients who had undergone germline genetic testing between 2015 and 2023.

"PurposeTo compare the intersection of gene expression levels and DNA methylation in monocyte cells of septic patients and healthy individuals, and to elucidate the primary molecular mechanisms by which monocyte cell DNA methylation contributes to the pathogenesis of sepsis.BackgroundSepsis is an extremely severe systemic infectious disease, triggered by a dysregulated immune response to the source of infection, leading to systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and ultimately resulting in multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). The mortality rate of sepsis is extremely high, especially among intensive care unit patients, with a mortality rate exceeding 30%, imposing significant psychological and economic burdens on patients’ families and society.ObjectiveThis study aims to determine the correlation between DNA methylation and the occurrence of sepsis through bioinformatics, hoping to provide a reference for future clinical treatment.MethodsR programming was used to analyze the differential genes between monocyte cells of septic patients and healthy individuals from the GSE9960 dataset available on the GEO website. DNA methylation-related genes were downloaded from the Genecards website, and Venn diagrams were employed to obtain intersecting genes. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analyses were performed for intersecting genes. STRING 13.0 was used for online analysis of co-expressed genes, and Cytoscape 3.8.0 was employed to analyze key proteins. The crucial sites affected by DNA methylation leading to sepsis were determined, and the clinical significance of Hub proteins corresponding to genes was evaluated using ROC curve analysis. The role of Hub genes in related pathways was explored through KEGG analysis.ResultsA total of 105 differential genes were identified in the GSE9960 dataset, including 73 upregulated and 32 downregulated genes. In the Genecards dataset, 11,867 relevant genes associated with DNA methylation and with a Relevance score of not less than 1 were found. The Venn diagram analysis revealed 76 intersecting genes. Biological processes (BP) enriched in the intersecting genes included regulation of cyclin-dependent protein serine/threonine kinase activity, and so on. Cellular components (CC) enriched in the intersecting genes included specific granule, and so on. Molecular functions (MF) included protein kinase regulator activity, and so on. KEGG analysis revealed enrichment in the Cell cycle pathway. Among the STRING interactions, genes such as CDKN3 showed significant relationships. KEGG analysis determined that CDC20 was involved in the Cell cycle pathway in monocyte cells of septic patients, and ROC curve analysis indicated the clinical diagnostic significance of CDC20.ConclusionGenomic analysis suggests that DNA methylation in monocyte cells may increase the risk of sepsis, which is associated with the activation of the CDC20 gene in monocyte cells.",Bioinformatics,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s44411-025-00040-9,1

"BackgroundLow-grade glioma (LGG) is a primary brain tumor with relatively low malignancy. NCOA4 is a key regulator of ferritinophagy-related processes and is involved in the occurrence and development of many cancers. However, the role of NCOA4 in LGG remains poorly understood.MethodsThis study comprehensively analyzed several mainstream bioinformatics databases to explore the expression, diagnostic efficacy, clinical pathological features, immune infiltration, prognostic value, and biological functions of NCOA4 in LGG. Immunohistochemistry experiments were conducted using LGG tissue samples collected from our hospital to validate the bioinformatics analysis results.ResultsNCOA4 expression was significantly elevated in LGG (p< 0.05), with an Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC) of 0.973, suggesting it as a potential diagnostic marker. High NCOA4 expression was associated with younger age (21–40 years), lower malignancy (oligodendroglioma), and better prognosis (IDHmut-non-codel and IDHmut-codel subtypes) (allp< 0.05) in LGG. Kaplan-Meier survival curves from three databases showed that high NCOA4-expressing LGG patients had better prognosis (allp< 0.05). NCOA4 correlated weakly with B cells, CD8 + T cells, macrophages, and dendritic cells infiltration (all with correlation coefficientsr< 0.3, andp< 0.05) in LGG. Multivariate Cox regression identified NCOA4, age, CD8 T cells, and macrophages as LGG independent prognostic factors (allp< 0.05). Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses indicated that NCOA4’s primary function in LGG is related to autophagy processes (allp< 0.05).ConclusionOur findings suggest that NCOA4 could be a potential prognostic marker and therapeutic target in LGG.",Bioinformatics,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12883-025-04036-4,1

The Basal-Like Immune-Suppressed (BLIS) subtype exhibits intensely poor outcomes due to immune avoidance mechanisms. This study employs inclusive bioinformatics approaches to recognize immune-related hub genes within the BLIS subtype to uncover potential therapeutic targets and prognostic biomarkers. Starting with the gene expression dataset containing 58,000 genes from 360 TNBC patients, we filtered low-expression genes and applied variance stabilizing transformation (VST) using DESeq2. Differential expression analysis across the four recognized TNBC subtypes—BLIS, Mesenchymal (MES), Luminal Androgen Receptor (LAR), and Immunomodulatory (IM) identified 353 significantly expressed genes, comprising 124 upregulated and 229 downregulated differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Pathway enrichment analysis revealed significant dysregulation of immune-related processes. We constructed a protein–protein interaction (PPI) network with 36 genes and applied Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) in STRING with a high confidence threshold (0.900).

We employed a systematic approach combining: gene identification through transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS); causal inference using summary data-based Mendelian randomization (SMR) and two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses; additional analyses included phenome-wide association analysis, enrichment analysis, protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks, drug repurposing, molecular docking and clinical validation through aldosterone-producing adenomas (APAs) tissue. Through systematic screening and prioritization, we identified 163 PA-associated genes, of which seven emerged as potential drug targets: CEP104, HIP1, TONSL, ZNF100, SHMT1, and two long non-coding RNAs (AC006369.2 and MRPL23-AS1). SHMT1 was identified as the most promising target, showing significantly elevated expression in APAs compared to adjacent non-tumorous tissues. Drug repurposing analysis identified four potential SHMT1-targeting compounds (Mimosine, Pemetrexed, Leucovorin, and Irinotecan), supported by molecular docking studies. The integration of multiple bioinformatics methods and experimental validation successfully identified novel drug targets for hyperaldosteronism. SHMT1, in particular, represents a promising candidate for future therapeutic development. These findings provide new opportunities for developing causative treatments for PA, though further clinical validation is warranted.",Bioinformatics,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1038/s41598-025-85900-8,1
"Endothelin-1 (ET-1) plays a critical role in diabetic vasculopathy. Although clinical trials have shown promise for ET-1 receptor antagonists in treating diabetic nephropathy, their clinical use remains limited by adverse effects. MiR-454-3p targets ET-1. This study aimed to investigate the role of miR-454-3p in modulating ET-1 expression and related molecular changes in endothelial cells (ECs) under high glucose conditions using both bioinformatics and experimental approaches. Bioinformatics analysis identified 10 miR-454-3p target genes expressed in ECs previously implicated in diabetic vascular complications: ET-1, GJA1, IRF1, PIK3CB, TRPC3, SLMAP, ESR1, ITGB8, MAPK1, and PPARG. With the exception of PPARG, which protects ECs from hyperglycemia-induced damage, all have been reported to exacerbate endothelial dysfunction. Western blotting showed that high glucose increased ET-1 expression in human umbilical vein ECs (HUVECs) and human dermal microvascular endothelial cells (HDMECs), while miR-454-3p overexpression significantly suppressed this effect in both cell types. Conditioned medium (CM) from HUVECs transfected with miR-454-3p mimics enhanced eNOS expression in recipient cells, compared to control CM. Pre-treatment of HUVEC control CM with an anti-ET-1 antibody also increased eNOS expression, supporting that miR-454-3p promotes NOS production partly via ET-1 suppression. MiR-454-3p overexpression in HUVECs did not affect PPARG expression or cell proliferation. In conclusion, miR-454-3p overexpression inhibits high glucose-induced ET-1 expression in HUVECs and HDMECs, and promotes eNOS production without affecting PPARG expression in HUVECs. Our findings suggest that miR-454-3p modulates ET-1 expression under hyperglycemic conditions in vitro, which may provide a foundation for future studies exploring its potential application in managing diabetic vasculopathy.",Bioinformatics,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13577-025-01309-5,1
"Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) represents one of the most common subtypes of lung cancer with high rates of incidence and mortality, which contributes to substantial health and economic demand across the globe. Treatment today mainly consists of surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy, but their efficacy in advanced stages is often suboptimal and emphasizes the clear need for new biomarkers and therapeutic targets. Using comprehensive bioinformatics analyses consisting of the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), Human Protein Atlas (HPA) and Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC), immune infiltration analysis and functional enrichment analysis, and single-cell analysis, we examined the potential of keratin 18 (KRT18) as a candidate biomarker in advanced LUAD. KRT18 was significantly elevated in LUAD tissue relative to normal adjacent tissue (p < 0.05), and its expression was correlated with poor clinical-pathological features and inferior prognostic outcome. Furthermore, KRT18 expression was associated with several populations of immune cells, suggesting KRT18 may contribute to the local tumor microenvironment and potentially pathways of immune evasion. Survival analysis indicated that elevated KRT18 expression correlated with poor overall survival (OS), disease-specific survival (DSS), and progression-free interval (PFI), reinforcing its legitimacy as a prognostic tool (AUC = 0.846). Importantly, gene enrichment analysis found KRT18-associated genes enriched for pathways associated with lymphocyte differentiation and immune response pathways, which provides mechanistic insight into biological effects attributed to KRT18. Notably, NU.1025 has demonstrated the capability of reversing KRT18-modulated oncogenic features, and targeted therapeutic strategies can be developed moving forward. In conclusion, our data demonstrate that KRT18 has utility as a potential biomarker but may also serve as a therapeutic target in LUAD and merit further investigation into underlying mechanistic functions and potential therapeutic roles in the clinic.",Bioinformatics,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12672-024-01728-0,1
"Actin is present in the cytoplasm and nucleus of every eukaryotic cell. In the cytoplasm, framework and motor functions of actin are associated with its ability to polymerize to form F-actin. In the nucleus, globular actin plays a significant functional role. For a globular protein, actin has a uniquely large number of proteins with which it interacts. Bioinformatics analysis of the actin interactome showed that only a part of actin-binding proteins are both cytoplasmic and nuclear. There are proteins that interact only with cytoplasmic, or only with nuclear actin. The first pool includes proteins associated with the formation, regulation, and functioning of the actin cytoskeleton predominate, while nuclear actin-binding proteins are involved in the majority of key nuclear processes, from regulation of transcription to DNA damage response. Bioinformatics analysis of the structure of actin-binding proteins showed that these are mainly intrinsically disordered proteins, many of which are part of membrane-less organelles. Interestingly, although the number of intrinsically disordered actin-binding proteins in the nucleus is greater than in the cytoplasm, the drivers for the formation of the membrane-less organelles in the cytoplasm are significantly (four times) greater than in the nucleus.",Bioinformatics,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10930-024-10207-y,1
"Intervertebral disc degeneration (IVDD) is a major contributor to lumbar degenerative diseases and chronic low back pain, while the role of ferroptosis in its pathogenesis remains incompletely understood. In this study, we integrated transcriptomic and single-cell RNA sequencing analyses to systematically identify ferroptosis-related key gene networks and explore potential pharmacological interventions. Bioinformatics analysis identified seven core hub genes, including JUN, TGFB1, MAPK1, CDKN1A, DUSP1, TIMP1, and HSF1, which were mainly enriched in ErbB, HIF-1, FoxO, and MAPK signaling pathways. Single-cell analysis revealed 12 major cell subpopulations, among which inflammatory and chondrocyte-like nucleus pulposus (NP) cells were significantly enriched in degenerated discs. CytoTRACE trajectory inference indicated that regenerative and notochordal-like NP cells exhibited higher differentiation potential. The hub genes showed highly heterogeneous expression patterns across cell types, and the interaction strength between inflammatory NP cells and macrophages was markedly increased, suggesting their involvement in the degenerative microenvironment and ferroptosis regulation. Based on drug prediction and molecular docking, resveratrol demonstrated strong binding affinities with most core targets, with binding energies below − 5 kcal/mol. In vitro experiments further confirmed that resveratrol significantly improved IL-1β-induced reduction of NP cell viability as assessed by CCK-8 assays. RT-qPCR analysis showed that resveratrol effectively suppressed the overexpression of JUN, TGFB1, MAPK1, DUSP1, TIMP1, and HSF1, while upregulating the expression of CDKN1A, thereby exerting a protective effect. Collectively, this study systematically elucidates the ferroptosis-related molecular networks and their distribution across cellular subpopulations in IVDD, and demonstrates the potential of resveratrol as a candidate therapeutic agent, providing novel insights for targeted intervention strategies.",Bioinformatics,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00210-025-04826-0,1
"Intestinal ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury is a serious threat to human health and has high mortality and morbidity rates. Several studies have examined the role of necroptosis in intestinal I/R injury. However, the specific mechanism and signaling pathways involved in necroptosis in intestinal I/R are still unclear.  Bioinformatics analysis and experimental validation were utilized to investigate the role of necroptosis in intestinal I/R injury. The dataset of target genes and disease genes was constructed using the R programming language and software environment. An interaction network of genes or proteins was built using GO and KEGG enrichment analysis to investigate the likely mechanism involved. Finally, the potential role of necroptosis in intestinal I/R injury was further verified experimentally.  Eighteen differentially expressed genes were identified via the construction of target and disease gene dataset. The core gene heat shock protein 90 alpha family class A member 1 (HSP90AA1) was identified via coexpression network analysis of related protein and genes. The expression of HSP90AA1 and phosphorylated mixed lineage kinase domain-like protein (p-MLKL) in human ischemic intestinal tissues were increased in ischemic intestinal tissue (P< 0.05). The same results were also shown in IEC-6 cells subjected to H/R injury, where the expression of HSP90AA1 and p-MLKL was considerably greater in the H/R group than in the normal group (P< 0.05). We further used siRNA to inhibit HSP90AA1 expression in IEC-6 cells, the p-MLKL protein expression level was lower in the H/R + si-HSP90AA1 group than in the H/R group (P< 0.05). HSP90AA1 promotes the development of intestinal I/R-induced necroptosis and plays a crucial role in intestinal I/R injury. HSP90AA1 may be a new therapeutic target for intestinal I/R injury.",Bioinformatics,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1038/s41598-025-22345-z,1
"The identification of reliable biomarkers is essential for improving breast cancer (BC) detection, prognosis, and treatment. This study explores a human telomeric G-quadruplex (G4) model, tel46, functionalized on Controlled Pore Glass (CPG) support, as a novel biomarker discovery tool. The oligonucleotide tel46mimics multimeric G4 structures in telomeric overhangs. Using affinity purification-mass spectrometry, 93 proteins interacting with tel46were identified starting from nuclear extract of MCF7 cells, linking them to pathways in DNA replication, repair, and genome stability, which are frequently altered in cancer. Integrating AP-MS data with quantitative proteomics comparing MCF7 to non-tumorigenic MCF10A cells, 27 tel46interactors were identified among upregulated proteins. Functional analyses revealed enrichment in genome maintenance and repair pathways, while downregulated proteins were associated with fundamental cellular functions. Further bioinformatics analysis using public cancer proteomics database 19 were validated. Bioinformatic analysis based on transcriptomics and clinical data revealed MSH6, MSH2, ESRP1, and WDHD1 as the most promising potential biomarkers for breast cancer. Indeed, these proteins are highly expressed in BC and generally correlated to poor prognosis: in addition to their role as potential biomarkers for early diagnosis, these proteins might be used as targets for specific treatment, enhancing radiation sensitivity or decreasing tumour cell proliferation. As a proof-of-concept, this study proposes tel46-functionalized CPG as a potential tool for isolating cancer-related proteins and underscores the potential of G4-interacting proteins as biomarkers for BC diagnosis and therapy. Moreover, these findings establish a basis for further research into G4-mediated cancer mechanisms.",Bioinformatics,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12935-025-03955-z,1
"BackgroundAlthough increasing evidence suggests that microRNAs (miRNAs) play different roles in the occurrence, development, and prognosis of colorectal cancer (CRC), investigations on miRNA-targeted regulation in CRC are sparse. However, the high morbidity and mortality of CRC necessitates exploring this area of research for potential alternative therapeutic approaches to CRC.MethodsBioinformatics analysis was used to obtain the key Hub genes related to CRC, and survival analysis was performed to screen out the core genes. Meanwhile, verification was performed using CCK-8, Transwell, qPCR, WB, immunohistochemistry and dual luciferase assays at a cellular level.ResultsThis study identified the hub gene KLK6 associated with CRC based on the GEO and TCGA databases. Survival analysis revealed a significant decrease in the survival rate of CRC patients with increasing expression levels of KLK6. Target gene prediction confirmed that miR-431-5p can target KLK6. Cell experimental results demonstrated that the miR-431-5p inhibitor enhanced cell viability and promoted cell migration and invasion while miR-431-5p mimics reduced cell viability and inhibited cell migration and invasion. Both the inhibitor and mimics of miR-431-5p suppressed and promoted the expression of miR-431-5p, as well as promoted and inhibited the KLK6 mRNA and protein expression. Dual luciferase results showed that miR-431-5p targeted KLK6, and cell recovery experiments further verified that miR-431-5p regulated cell viability, migration and invasion by targeting KLK6.ConclusionsThrough target gene prediction, miR-431-5p was found to target KLK6, suggesting its therapeutic potential in CRC. As such, therapies that can inhibit KLK6 via miR-431-5p offer a promising approach to CRC.Clinical trial numberNot applicable.",Bioinformatics,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s41065-025-00395-7,1
"BackgroundCutaneous melanoma (CM) is strongly associated with ultraviolet (UV) radiation, which contributes to the transformation of melanocytes into melanoma by inducing specific DNA damage. Here, we investigated the causal relationship between CM and genes related to sun-damaged skin, exploring specific target genes through various bioinformatics analyses.MethodsThe Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database was used to obtain differential genes for CM and normal skin, and the Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) analysis offered summary-level melanoma data for CM. Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses were used to examine the correlated linkage between CM and sun-exposed skin genes. The MR studies were conducted mainly using Inverse Variance Weighting (IVW), MR-Egger, Weighted Median, simple and weighted patterns to predict the correlation between sun-exposed skin and CM. Finally, the role of target genes in CM was revealed by pan-cancer analysis, expression and immune-infiltration evaluations, immuno-checking targeting analysis, immunotherapy response analysis, survival analysis, and protein-protein interactions (PPI) network and enrichment analyses.ResultUsing matrix data from the GSE15605, GSE46517, and GSE111452 datasets, bioinformatics analysis revealed 232 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between CM and typical tissues. MR analysis indicated that only CTSS has a deleterious effect linking skin exposure to sunlight and CM. Analysis of CTSS expression in tumors and tissues, along with the construction of a prognostic model, revealed that CTSS expression was higher in both primary CM and metastatic CM compared to normal skin tissue. However, patients with higher CTSS expression had a higher prognosis. In addition, high CTSS expression was significantly and positively correlated with tumor mutation rate, tumor microenvironment, immune cell infiltration, immune checkpoints and immunotherapy efficacy.ConclusionUsing MR analysis, we found a positive causal relationship between the CTSS gene in sun-exposed skin and CM. Additionally, increased CTSS may provide a basis for biomarker prediction of CM prognosis, immune status and immunotherapy.",Bioinformatics,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12885-025-13481-w,1
"It is crucial to select the most relevant and informative features in a dataset to perform data analysis. Machine learning algorithms perform better when features are selected correctly. Feature selection is not solvable in polynomial time. The exact method takes exponential time, so the researchers used approximate algorithms to reach semi-optimal solutions. It is impossible to explore and exploit the search space in a balanced manner when using heuristic algorithms and metaheuristic methods. To solve this problem, the proposed method replaces meta-heuristic algorithms with the linear time SKEW algorithm in bioinformatics. First, each feature is ranked using the Pearson correlation criterion. Each feature is labeledA,C,G, orTaccording to its rank. The best feature isA, and the worst feature isT. The dataset can now be viewed as Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA). In the second step, the SKEW algorithm is used to determine the lexico-graphical order of suffixes. Suffixes are considered and checked as selected features. The third step involves permuting the features, and the first and second steps are repeated. The best suffix with the lowest cost function is selected after multiple iterations (e.g., ten). As compared to Simulated Annealing (SA), Genetic Algorithm (GA), Gray Wolf Optimizer (GWO), Grasshopper Optimization Algorithm (GOA), Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), Greedy, Gravitational Search Algorithm (GSA), and Pyramid Gravitational Search Algorithm (PGSA), the proposed algorithm improves the objective function by 19.3%, 7.6%, 80.6%, 102.2%, 39.7%, 105.6%, 38.1%, and 14.2% respectively.",Bioinformatics,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13042-024-02509-5,1
"Ischemic stroke (IS) constitutes a severe neurological disorder with restricted treatment alternatives. Recent investigations have disclosed that glycosylation is closely associated with the occurrence and outcome of IS. Nevertheless, data on the transcriptomic dynamics of glycosylation in IS are lacking. The objective of this study was to undertake a comprehensive exploration of glycosylation-related genes (GRGs) in IS via bioinformatics and to assess their immune characteristics. In this study, through the intersection of genes from weighted gene co-expression network analysis, GRGs from five glycosylation pathways, and DEGs from differential expression analysis, 20 candidate GRGs were identified. Subsequently, through LASSO, Random Forest, and SVM-RFE, 3 hub GRGs (F5, PPP6C, and UBE2J1) were identified. Additional, a gene diagnostic model linked to glycosylation was developed and validated. The findings indicated that the diagnostic model could effectively distinguish between IS patients and healthy individuals in the training, validation, and merging datasets, indicating clinical relevance. Subsequently, by employing unsupervised clustering analysis, IS patients were classified into three clusters, and significant disparities were witnessed in immune cell infiltration among distinct clusters. In summary, this study successfully identified hub GRGs in IS and investigated the roles of these hub genes in the immune microenvironment, indicating potential clinical applications for IS.",Bioinformatics,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12031-025-02352-5,1
"Epidemiological association between psoriasis and T2DM suggests shared pathophysiology that are to be explored. Microarray expression profiles for psoriasis and T2DM were obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. The “limma” package in R software was used to screen the differentially expressed genes (DEG). GO and KEGG enrichment analysis were further conducted to explore the functions of co-DEGs. By intesecting genes of the key disease-related modules from WGCNA with co-DEGs, candidate co-driver genes were identified and their PPI network was constructed. Hub genes with good diagnostic potential were obtained by ROC analysis and their expression was further compared in validation datasets as well as clinical samples. The crucial co-driver genes, identified by a consistently differential expression pattern, were further subjected to a series of analyses, including Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA), immune cell infiltration analysis, gene-chemistry networks analysis, gene-transcription factors (TF) network analysis, and gene-miRNA regulatory network analysis. In our study, 71 co-DEGs were identifed from psoriasis and T2DM training datasets. KEGG analysis revealed enrichment of pathways including toll-like receptor signaling pathway, cytokine-cytokine receptor interactions, chemokine signaling pathway, NOD-like receptor signaling pathway and cytosolic DNA-sensing pathway. By intersecting the critical WCGNA modules with co-DEGs, 33 candidate co-driver genes were obtained. 11 of them showed interactions with others on PPI network and 7 revealed good diagnostic value with AUC > 0.7 by ROC analysis. 4 genes, namelyBEX5,EPHX2,GPRASP1, andRBP4were finally identified as crucial co-driver genes with a consistent differential expression pattern in both training and validation datasets as well as validation experiments using clinical samples. GSEA analysis revealed that these crucial co-driver genes were involved in cytokine receptor interaction, proteasome, ribosome, apoptosis and so on. Immune cell infiltration and correlation analyses highlighted their roles in the immune microenvironment. Lastly, these genes targeted 76 skin and metabolic diseases and 135 chemicals were predicted to exert an modulatory effect of their expression. 13 TFs and 79 miRNAs were identified to modulate their expression. The integrated bioinformatics analysis conducted in our study identified co-DEGs and enriched immune-inflammatory pathways, providing novel insights into the pathogenesis underlying the comorbidity of psoriasis and T2DM.

"Liver cirrhosis (LC) is a common chronic disease worldwide with a poor prognosis, and its pathogenesis has not been fully elucidated. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are crucial in LC progression. Here, we identified TLR-related genes, providing novel insights related to LC diagnosis, pathogenesis, and treatment. Data from public databases were analyzed using “limma” and WGCNA to screen candidate genes, and four hub genes (CXCL9, CXCL10, SPP1, CTSK) were selected through machine learning. These hub genes were validated through bioinformatics, quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), and immunohistochemistry (IHC). Both the hub genes and risk models demonstrated strong diagnostic potential for LC. The hub genes were enriched in various pathways and strongly correlated with immune infiltration. Subtypes characterized by different TLR signaling activity exhibited distinct immune responses. scRNA-seq analysis revealed significant differences in hub gene expression and TLR signaling activity across different cell types. ceRNA network analysis revealed interactions involving miRNAs, lncRNAs, and hub genes. Molecular docking supported the potential value of the hub genes as drug targets. In conclusion, TLR-related hub genes exhibit excellent diagnostic and therapeutic value in LC, and their dysregulation contributes to immune disorders and activation of pathogenic signaling pathways.

Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying non-union fractures is crucial for developing effective therapeutic interventions. This study integrates bioinformatics analysis and experimental validation to unravel key genes and pathways associated with non-union fractures. We identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between non-union and fracture healing tissues using bioinformatics techniques. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses were employed to elucidate the biological processes and pathways involved. Common DEGs were identified, and a protein–protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed.Fibronectin-1(FN1),Thrombospondin-1(THBS1), andBiglycan(BGN) were pinpointed as critical target genes for non-union fracture treatment.

"The purpose of the research was to evaluate the diagnostic performance of microRNA-299-3p (miR-299-3p) in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). The relative abundance of miR-299-3p in patients with CAD was verified by quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) assay. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) were used for analysis, and target genes were predicted and enriched by DAVID software. The protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was drawn by STRING database. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) was adopted to appraise the diagnostic value of miR-299-3p in CAD. Bioinformatics analysis showed that the GO function of miR-299-3p target genes of miR-299-3p mainly focuses on specific granular membrane, regulation of apoptotic signaling pathway, growth factor binding and so on. KEGG analysis showed that the most abundant pathways involve fluid shear stress and atherosclerosis, as well as Notch signaling pathways. PPI network showed the seven predictive genes encoding the proteins play pivotal roles in maintaining the stability and interaction of the network, especially matrix metallopeptidase 2 (MMP2) and intercellular cell adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM1). Compared with the control group, serum miR-299-3p in the CAD group was distinctly up-regulated via qRT-PCR (p< 0.001).

"Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a life-threatening disease with a poor prognosis, and metabolic abnormalities play a critical role in its development. This study used metabolomics, machine learning algorithms and bioinformatics to screen for potential metabolic biomarkers associated with the diagnosis of PAH. In this study, plasma samples were collected from 17 patients diagnosed with idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (IPAH) and 20 healthy controls. Plasma metabolomic profiling was performed by high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Gene profiles of PAH patients were obtained from the GEO database. Key differentially expressed metabolites (DEMs) and metabolism-related genes were subsequently identified using machine learning algorithms. Twenty differential plasma metabolites associated with IPAH were identified (VIP score > 1 andp< 0 0.05), and enrichment analysis revealed the arginine biosynthesis pathway as the most altered pathway. Using machine learning models, including least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), random forest (RF) and support vector machine (SVM), we extracted key metabolites that correlated with clinical phenotypes. Our results suggested that five metabolites, kynurenine, homoserine, tryptophan, AMP, and spermine, are potential biomarkers for IPAH. Bioinformatics analysis also identified 3 metabolism-related genes, MAPK6, SLC7A11 and CDC42BPA, that are strongly correlated with pulmonary hypertension, demonstrating strong predictive power and clinical relevance. Our findings revealed some key genes associated with metabolism in PH, and provided crucial information about complex metabolic reprogramming signals and may lead to the identification of useful metabolic biomarkers for the diagnosis of PAH.",Bioinformatics,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1038/s41598-024-76514-7,1
"BackgroundStomach adenocarcinoma (STAD) remains a significant threat to human health. This study sought to discover clinically relevant biomarkers for STAD by integrating bioinformatics analysis and in vitro experimental methods.MethodsWe utilized the GSE64951 dataset to screen for differentially expressed genes (DEGs), which were then subjected to weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA). Candidate modules were subjected to Molecular Complex Detection (MCODE) analysis to extract key genes. Survival analysis and immune infiltration analysis were conducted to identify hub genes associated with STAD prognosis. Among them, cytochrome c oxidase subunit 7 C (COX7C) was selected for further investigation. Its expression levels in normal versus tumor tissues were compared, and its diagnostic performance was assessed via receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. Functional experiments, including COX7C overexpression and knockdown, were performed in MGC803 cells to evaluate its effects on viability, apoptosis, migration, and invasion.ResultsWGCNA identified multiple gene modules, among which the blue and turquoise modules showed the strongest correlations with clinical traits and were selected for further analysis. MCODE analysis identified 11 key genes. COX7C was identified as hub gene, and its prognostic signature demonstrated robust predictive power. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) indicated that COX7C was significantly involved in pathways such as amino acid metabolism and non - alcoholic fatty liver disease. Notably, COX7C mRNA expression was significantly downregulated in STAD tissues (AUC = 0.7253,P= 0.0032). Functional experiments demonstrated that overexpression of COX7C significantly inhibited cell viability, promoted apoptosis, and reduced cell migration and invasion. Conversely, knockdown of COX7C led to opposite effects.ConclusionCOX7C functions as a tumor suppressor and a potential prognostic biomarker in STAD. These findings provide new insights into STAD pathogenesis and suggest COX7C as a promising target for improving diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.",Bioinformatics,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12876-025-04253-8,1
"BackgroundPreeclampsia, characterized by hypertension and proteinuria during pregnancy, poses significant risks to both mother and fetus. The complement system’s aberrant activation, notably the C3AR1, is important to the pathogenesis of preeclampsia, although the precise mechanisms are not fully understood.Materials and methodsUtilizing the Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD) and Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB), we identified complement system targets associated with preeclampsia and environmental pollutants. Expression validation was conducted through the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. Molecular docking predicted interactions between BPA, PFOS, and C3AR1. Immunohistochemical staining of 80 placental tissues (40 early-onset preeclampsia and 40 healthy controls) confirmed C3AR1 expression and its clinical correlation. Integrated bioinformatics analyses revealed C3AR1’s role in preeclampsia’s molecular mechanisms. Functional verification was assessed by knocking down C3AR1 in HTR-8/Svneo cells, including cell proliferation, invasion, and apoptosis.ResultsNetwork pharmacology established connections between pollutants and preeclampsia, with C3AR1 as a key target. Molecular docking confirmed BPA and PFOS binding to C3AR1. Reduced C3AR1 in preeclamptic placentas correlated with maternal blood pressure, and showed high diagnostic potential (AUC = 0.95). C3AR1’s involvement in preeclampsia was linked to Jak-STAT, TGF-β, and HIF-1 pathways, and associated with NK cell and M1 macrophage activity. C3AR1 knockdown in HTR-8/Svneo cells decreased proliferation and invasion, and increased apoptosis.ConclusionC3AR1 expression is diminished in preeclampsia placental tissues, correlating with disease severity, suggesting its potential as a biomarker. It is crucial for cellular functions and inflammation, with future studies aiming to leverage this for novel preeclampsia treatments.Clinical trialNot applicable.",Bioinformatics,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12884-025-07221-y,1
"Esophageal cancer (ESCA) is a significant malignancy with rising global incidence rates and considerable impacts on patient survival and quality of life. Current diagnostic and therapeutic strategies face limitations, necessitating research into its underlying mechanisms and potential biomarkers for early diagnosis. This study aims to investigate the role of perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), an environmental toxicant, in the development of ESCA through a comprehensive bioinformatics approach. Using the TCGA-ESCA dataset, we identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and intersected them with PFOS-related toxicity targets predicted via Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD) and SuperPred. Machine learning (Random Forest, XGBoost, LASSO, SVM) were applied to prioritize core targets. Survival analysis, in vitro qPCR (ESO-26/FLO-1 cells), and molecular docking were performed. Immune infiltration and pathway activity (GSVA) were assessed. We identified 98 PFOS-related DEGs in ESCA, enriched in hypoxia response, epithelial migration, and cancer-associated pathways (e.g., AGE-RAGE, PI3K-Akt). Machine learning highlighted three core targets: PLAU, TOP2A, and BAX. High expression of these genes correlated with poor survival (PLAU,p= 0.047) and was upregulated in ESCA tissues. PFOS exposure significantly elevated their expression in esophageal cancer cells. Molecular docking revealed strong binding affinities between PFOS and core targets. GSVA linked PLAU/TOP2A/BAX to oncogenic pathways (angiogenesis, DNA repair), while immune analysis showed PLAU’s association with stromal infiltration and TOP2A’s negative correlation with CD8 + T cells. PFOS exacerbates ESCA by dysregulating PLAU, TOP2A, and BAX, which drive tumor progression via immune modulation, genomic instability, and oncogenic signaling. These targets may serve as biomarkers and therapeutic vulnerabilities for PFOS-associated ESCA, underscoring the need for environmental regulation and targeted therapies.",Bioinformatics,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1038/s41598-025-15765-4,1
"COVID-19, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, poses significant health challenges worldwide, particularly due to severe immune-related complications. Understanding the molecular mechanisms and identifying key immune-related genes (IRGs) involved in COVID-19 pathogenesis is critical for developing effective prevention and treatment strategies. This study employed computational tools to analyze biological data (bioinformatics) and a method for inferring causal relationships based on genetic variations, known as Mendelian randomization (MR), to explore the roles of IRGs in COVID-19. We identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs) from datasets available in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), comparing COVID-19 patients with healthy controls. IRGs were sourced from the ImmPort database. We conducted functional enrichment analysis, pathway analysis, and immune infiltration assessments to determine the biological significance of the identified IRGs. A total of 360 common differential IRGs were identified. Among these genes, CD1C, IL1B, and SLP1 have emerged as key IRGs with potential protective effects against COVID-19. Pathway enrichment analysis revealed that CD1C is involved in terpenoid backbone biosynthesis and Th17 cell differentiation, while IL1B is linked to B-cell receptor signaling and the NF-kappa B signaling pathway. Significant correlations were observed between key genes and various immune cells, suggesting that they influence immune cell modulation in COVID-19. This study provides new insights into the immune mechanisms underlying COVID-19, highlighting the crucial role of IRGs in disease progression. These findings suggest that CD1C and IL1B could be potential therapeutic targets. The integrated bioinformatics and MR analysis approach offers a robust framework for further exploring immune responses in COVID-19 patients, as well as for targeted therapy and vaccine development.",Bioinformatics,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1038/s41598-024-81803-2,1
"Nitric Oxide Synthase 3 (NOS3)G894 T (rs1799983)is an important regulator of cardiac development. Its role in congenital heart disease (CHD) has been extensively studied in recent years, but the results are contradictory. The aim of the present study was to better elucidate the relationship between the NOS3G894 Tgene polymorphism and susceptibility of CHD and its specific subtypes. A comprehensive literature search was conducted across several databases, including PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, CNKI, VIP, and Wan Fang. Meta-analysis was carried out using RevMan 5.4 software, and the odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) was used as the effect measure. Additionally, bioinformatics analysis was employed to explore the impact of NOS3 gene mutations on tetralogy of Fallot (TOF), using publicly available microarray datasets to assess NOS3 gene expression. Nine studies were included, comprising 1931 CHD cases and 1910 controls. Meta-analysis showed that the NOS3G894 Tpolymorphism was associated with an increased risk of CHD in three genetic models: allele model (TvsG, OR = 1.31, 95% CI [1.02, 1.68],P= 0.04), homozygous model (TTvsGG, OR = 1.60, 95% CI [1.13, 2.26],P= 0.007), and dominant model (GT+TTvsGG, OR = 1.44, 95% CI [1.02, 2.05],P= 0.04). Subgroup analyses revealed a strong association with atrial septal defect (ASD), conotruncal defects (CTD), and septal defects, with the most significant correlation found for ASD. The NOS3G894 Tpolymorphism was associated with the risk of CHD in ethnic subgroup, increasing the risk of CHD in white race. Bioinformatics analysis did not find significant differences in NOS3 gene expression between individuals with TOF. The NOS3G894 T (rs1799983)gene polymorphism is significantly associated with the risk of CHD, with notable variations in this association across different regions and ethnic groups. TheTallele increases the risk of CHD by 31% compared to theGallele. Additionally, this polymorphism is linked to specific CHD subtypes, especially ASD.",Bioinformatics,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00210-025-04252-2,1
"The exponential growth of bioinformatics and drug discovery data necessitates computational frameworks capable of efficiently managing large-scale, heterogeneous, and continuously evolving datasets. This study presents a hybrid deep learning framework built upon a microservices-based architecture to enhance scalability, modularity, and efficiency in bioinformatics workflows. The proposed system integrates generative deep learning—specifically, a variational autoencoder (VAE)—to tackle challenges in bioinformatics. Through a microservices-driven design, the framework enables modular deployment, semantic interoperability, and scalable integration of generative models into bioinformatics pipelines. The architecture is model-agnostic and supports flexible validation by encapsulating cheminformatics evaluations, as independent microservices. This allows automated updates and seamless incorporation of new evaluation metrics without disrupting the overall pipeline. Rather than replicating existing cheminformatics validation efforts, the framework provides an extensible foundation for integrating, reusing, and scaling such studies across large datasets in bioinformatics and drug discovery. In contrast to traditional monolithic architectures, the microservices paradigm supports independent deployment, optimization, and scaling of deep learning components—such as molecule generation, toxicity prediction, and pharmacokinetics analysis—while maintaining uninterrupted workflow execution. This design ensures real-time data processing, interoperability across distributed systems, and reduced computational overhead. Experiments conducted on benchmark datasets from DrugBank, ChEMBL, and TCGA demonstrate superior performance compared to monolithic baselines in predictive accuracy, biomarker identification, and computational efficiency. These results underscore the potential of microservices as a software engineering paradigm for advancing bioinformatics and accelerating the drug discovery process.",Bioinformatics,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40537-025-01320-5,1
"Brucellaspp., the causative agent of zoonotic brucellosis, poses a significant threat to both animal husbandry and human health. Given the limitations of current antibiotic treatments for human brucellosis, there is an urgent need to develop effective human vaccines. Using reverse vaccinology and bioinformatics approaches, we designed a multi-epitope vaccine (MEV) specifically targeting the CcmA, ccmC, and BepC membrane proteins, with the aim of providing robust protection against human infection.We screened 11 CTL, 9 HTL, 2 conformational B cell epitopes, and 9 linear B cell epitopes, linked them with GGGS,GPGPG and KK. and incorporated HMGN1 (high mobility group nucleosome binding protein 1) as an adjuvant and PADRE (a universal HTL epitope to enhance cross-population immunogenicity) to boost immunogenicity. Analyses showed the 638-amino-acid MEV had high antigenicity (1.2542, exceeded the threshold of 0.4), was non-toxic(ToxinPred2) and non-allergenic(AllergenFP), had low human homology(BLASTP e-value < 0.005), Instability index 26.80 (< 40),and good solubility(0.896, > 0.5).Molecular docking and dynamics confirmed its stability.

"BackgroundOsteoporosis (OP) is a common metabolic bone disease characterized by decreased bone mass and increased fracture risk. Recent studies suggest that oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of OP. This study aims to investigate the differential expression and potential functional roles of OXPHOS-related genes in OP.MethodsWe downloaded gene expression data from two OP-related datasets, GSE56815 and GSE7429, using the GEOquery package. We also collected OXPHOS-related genes from the GeneCards and MsigDB databases. The limma package was used for differential expression analysis of GSE56815, and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified. We intersected these DEGs with OXPHOS-related genes to identify OXPHOS-related differentially expressed genes. Functional enrichment analyses, includingGene Ontology(GO) andKyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes(KEGG), were conducted using the clusterProfiler package. Additionally, we performed gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA). The Mann–WhitneyUtest analyzed differences in the expression of OXPHOSRDEGs, and their diagnostic potential was assessed by Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves. Correlation analysis, Protein–Protein Interaction (PPI) network construction, mRNA-miRNA, mRNA-TF interaction network construction, and immune infiltration analysis using CIBERSORT were also conducted. RAW264.7 cells were induced in vitro for 3 days to differentiate towards osteoblasts, and RT-PCR assay was used to verify the differentiation and detect the differential expression of target genes.ResultsOur results identified 31 DEGs in GSE56815, with 26 upregulated and 5 downregulated genes. Among these, we identified 10 OXPHOSRDEGs:VPS35, TBC1D2, UBQLN2, SH3GLB2, WWP1, NFKBIA, MFSD10, SLC2 A3, RP2,andZNF91. GO and KEGG enrichment analyses revealed significant involvement of these genes in mechanisms such as the positive regulation of the protein catabolic process and the endocytosis pathway. ROC analysis demonstrated high diagnostic accuracy forVPS35(AUC = 0.832) andTBC1D2(AUC = 0.751). Correlation analysis indicated strong relationships between certain OXPHOSRDEGs. The PPI network highlighted 8 hub genes with significant functional similarity among them.ConclusionThis study systematically elucidates the differential expression and potential mechanisms of OXPHOS-related genes in OP through comprehensive bioinformatics analyses.

"Huntington’s disease (HD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by CAG repeat expansion in the HTT gene, leading to oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and neuroinflammation. Conventional therapies offer only symptomatic relief with limited efficacy. This study aimed to explore the neuroprotective potential ofMucuna pruriens(MP) andBoswellia serrata(BS) through an integrative bioinformatics approach, targeting multiple pathological mechanisms implicated in HD. Phytoconstituents from MP and BS were selected based on pharmacokinetic properties, including drug-likeness and blood–brain barrier permeability. Differential gene expression analysis was performed using GEO datasets to identify HD-related genes. Target prediction, network pharmacology, protein–protein interaction (PPI) network construction, and pathway enrichment analyses were carried out. Key proteins were subjected to molecular docking using AutoDock Vina and stability was evaluated through molecular dynamics simulations. A total of 47 phytoconstituents were identified, associated with 1333 (MP) and 693 (BS) potential targets. Network pharmacology revealed the involvement of PI3K-Akt, MAPK, NF-kappa B, and neurotrophin signaling pathways. AKT1, MAPK1, and SLC6A3 emerged as central hub proteins. Molecular docking demonstrated strong binding affinities of levodopa, tyrosine, and phenylalanine with core HD-related proteins (AKT1, EGFR, and SLC6A3). Molecular dynamics simulations further confirmed complex stability, with RMSD values ranging between 1.8 and 3.2 Å across key ligand–protein pairs supporting their neuroprotective potential. This integrative bioinformatics analysis highlights that phytoconstituents fromMucuna pruriensandBoswellia serratamodulate key molecular pathways involved in HD pathogenesis. MP exhibited antioxidative and dopamine-enhancing effects, while BS showed significant anti-inflammatory effects. These findings suggest that MP and BS may serve as promising plant-based therapeutic candidates for HD, warranting further in vitro and in vivo validation.",Bioinformatics,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40203-025-00398-2,1
"Breast cancer is the most common malignancy among women worldwide, with drug therapy playing a crucial role in its treatment. In recent years, poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitors, such as Olaparib, have shown significant efficacy in the management of BReast CAncer gene (BRCA)-mutated breast cancers. However, the emergence of resistance has become a major clinical challenge, limiting their long-term effectiveness. This in-silico study aimed to identify key genes associated with Olaparib resistance through comprehensive bioinformatics analysis. Differential expression and drug sensitivity prediction were performed to identify resistance-associated genes, followed by pathway enrichment and protein–protein interaction (PPI) network construction. Kaplan–Meier survival analysis and Cox regression were conducted to evaluate the prognostic value of candidate genes. Four immune-related genes—CD19, CXCL9, ICOS, and CXCL13—were identified as being closely associated with Olaparib resistance and relapse-free survival. Additionally, comparative drug sensitivity analysis revealed that high-risk subgroups may exhibit differential response patterns to specific chemotherapeutic agents.

"BackgroundClinical and epidemiological analyses have found an association between coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and knee osteoarthritis (KOA). Infection with COVID-19 may increase the risk of developing KOA.ObjectivesThis study aimed to investigate the potential causal relationship between COVID-19 and KOA using Mendelian randomization (MR) and to explore the underlying mechanisms through a systematic bioinformatics approach.MethodsOur investigation focused on exploring the potential causal relationship between COVID-19, acute upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) and KOA utilizing a bidirectional MR approach. Additionally, we conducted differential gene expression analysis using public datasets related to these three conditions. Subsequent analyses, including transcriptional regulation analysis, immune cell infiltration analysis, single-cell analysis, and druggability evaluation, were performed to explore potential mechanisms and prioritize therapeutic targets.ResultsThe results indicate that COVID-19 has a one-way impact on KOA, while URTI does not play a causal role in this association. Ribosomal dysfunction may serve as an intermediate factor connecting COVID-19 with KOA. Specifically, COVID-19 has the potential to influence the metabolic processes of the extracellular matrix, potentially impacting the joint homeostasis. A specific group of genes (COL10A1, BGN, COL3A1, COMP, ACAN, THBS2, COL5A1, COL16A1, COL5A2) has been identified as a shared transcriptomic signature in response to KOA with COVID-19. Imatinib, Adiponectin, Myricetin, Tranexamic acid, and Chenodeoxycholic acid are potential drugs for the treatment of KOA patients with COVID-19.ConclusionsThis study uniquely combines Mendelian randomization and bioinformatics tools to explore the possibility of a causal relationship and genetic association between COVID-19 and KOA. These findings are expected to provide novel perspectives on the underlying biological mechanisms that link COVID-19 and KOA.",Bioinformatics,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12920-024-02074-4,1
"Laryngeal cancer is a highly aggressive malignancy with high incidence and mortality rates. This study aims to identify potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets for laryngeal cancer through an integrated approach combining bioinformatics and machine learning, followed by experimental validation. We obtained laryngeal cancer tissue sample data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database and used Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) to identify key gene modules. These modules were then intersected with oxidative stress-related genes from the GeneCards database to determine core genes. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses of the core genes revealed that they are primarily involved in responses to xenobiotic stimuli, oxidative stress, and multiple signaling pathways. Cox regression analysis identified GPT and EPHX2 as independent risk factors for laryngeal cancer. Through a comprehensive analysis using LASSO regression and Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) networks, highlighted EPHX2 as a candidate gene of interest. Experimental results showed that the expression of EPHX2 in laryngeal cancer tissues was significantly lower than that in control tissues (p< 0.01). Additionally, EPHX2 expression was associated with increased infiltration of M0 macrophages (p< 0.01) and decreased infiltration of CD4 memory T cells (p< 0.01), suggest that EPHX2 expression correlates with immune-cell infiltration patterns and clinical outcomes. Western blot and immunohistochemistry corroborated the differential expression of EPHX2 between tumor and non-tumor tissues. Collectively, these findings uncover an oxidative stress-related gene signature in laryngeal cancer and suggest that EPHX2 expression correlates with immune-cell infiltration patterns and clinical outcomes. However, the present data are observational and do not establish a mechanistic or causal role for EPHX2 in laryngeal cancer progression or immune modulation; functional studies such as gene knockdown or overexpression assays are required to validate its biological role.",Bioinformatics,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00405-025-09762-6,1
"BackgroundProstate Cancer (PCa) is one of the most common malignant tumors in men. Some patients may progress to metastatic and Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer (CRPC), leading to increased treatment difficulty and poor prognosis. With advancements in bioinformatics and machine learning technologies, the integration of multiple databases can efficiently identify core genes associated with the occurrence of PCa. Additionally, the Tumor Microenvironment (TME) and immune cell infiltration play crucial roles in the development and therapeutic response of PCa. Investigating the interactions between core genes and the immune microenvironment will enhance the understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying PCa and provide new avenues for precision treatment.MethodsThis study obtained gene expression data of prostate cancer and normal tissues from the GEO (GSE69223, GSE46602) and TCGA (TCGA-PRAD) databases. Initially, each dataset was standardized, batch effects were corrected, and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified, followed by GO and KEGG enrichment analyses. Subsequently, the STRING database was utilized to construct a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network, and core modules were selected using Cytoscape software. Lasso regression and Random Forest (RF) algorithms were employed to further pinpoint core genes from the key genes. In the external validation dataset (GSE46602), the diagnostic value and expression level differences of these core genes were assessed. Combining data from TCGA-PRAD, their correlations with immune cell infiltration were analyzed. The application value in molecular pathways and potential therapeutic interventions was explored through GSEA and CTRP drug sensitivity data. Finally, immunohistochemistry and Western blot experiments were conducted to confirm the expression changes of core genes in Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH) and prostate cancer tissues, alongside correlation analyses with clinical pathological parameters.ResultsMulti-omics integrative analysis identified a total of 339 common DEGs. The PPI network and machine learning algorithms further identified four potential core genes: DKK3, SNAI2, WIF1, and FOXA1. External validation and diagnostic value assessments revealed that DKK3 and WIF1 were significantly downregulated in PCa tissues and positively correlated with higher PSA levels and Gleason scores. Immune cell infiltration analysis indicated that the downregulation of these genes was closely associated with impaired adaptive immune function and matrix remodeling, and synergistically interacted with abnormalities in the Wnt/TGF-β pathways. Further analysis using the CTRP database showed that high expression of DKK3 increased cellular sensitivity to various anti-tumor drugs, whereas high expression of WIF1 might reduce the efficacy of certain small molecule inhibitors. Immunohistochemistry and protein level detection in clinical samples confirmed that the expression levels of DKK3 and WIF1 were significantly decreased in PCa tissues and were closely associated with patients’ PSA levels and Gleason scores.ConclusionEvidence from integrated databases and clinical samples indicates that WIF1 and DKK3 are significantly downregulated in PCa. Their inactivation may accelerate tumor progression and drug resistance by relieving the negative regulation of the Wnt/TGF-β pathways and affecting the immune microenvironment. Targeting the restoration or enhancement of these two tumor suppressor genes could become a new direction for the early diagnosis and precision treatment of prostate cancer. When combined with personalized medication selection, this approach is expected to significantly improve clinical outcomes for high-risk PCa patients.",Bioinformatics,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12672-025-03488-x,1

"BackgroundAging increases health risks, particularly cardiovascular diseases, neurological disorders, and cancer. Elderly individuals experience complications from polypharmacy, underscoring the need for innovative therapies. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are promising in regenerative medicine but decline in number and function with age. This decline is exacerbated by non-heme iron accumulation, leading to cellular damage. Reducing iron may enhance MSCs function in the elderly, with deferoxamine mesylate (DFO), an iron chelator, potentially alleviating oxidative damage.MethodsThis study employed network pharmacology and bioinformatics to explore DFO’s effects on aged MSCs. Target genes of DFO were obtained from the PharmMapper server, while aging-related MSCs genes were sourced from four databases. Functional enrichment, protein-protein interaction network construction, and hub gene identification were performed, with validation using the GSE35959 and GSE68374 microarray datasets from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database.ResultsA total of 148 common genes associated with the aging of MSCs treated with DFO were identified. Validation revealed that DFO significantly impacts key pathways, including the Rap1 and PI3K-Akt signaling pathways. Additionally, 13 primary target genes involved in the regulation of cell cycle and division were identified. Notably, 7 of these genes exhibited similar expression patterns in both in vitro and in vivo studies, suggesting they could be crucial for MSCs aging and primary targets of DFO.ConclusionsThese findings shed light on DFO’s mechanisms for enhancing MSCs function and delaying aging, providing a foundation for future therapeutic strategies aimed at promoting repair and regeneration in aging populations.",Bioinformatics,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s44337-025-00473-9,1

"BackgroundAcute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a highly heterogeneous disease characterized by complex genetic and molecular features that contribute to poor prognosis and low cure rates. Therefore, identifying novel therapeutic targets is crucial for improving treatment efficacy and patient survival. This study investigated the potential role of cyclin-dependent kinase 9 (CDK9), a known regulator of gene expression, in AML pathogenesis and prognosis.MethodsThis study employed multiple bioinformatics approaches, including analysis of CDK9 expression across various cancers using the Tumor Immune Estimation Resource (TIMER2.0) database and further investigation of its expression and prognostic significance in AML using data from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) databases. Survival analysis and Cox regression analysis were used to assess the association between CDK9 expression and patient prognosis. Gene Ontology (GO), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) were performed to elucidate the pathways and biological processes influenced by CDK9. Furthermore, the relationship between CDK9 expression and tumor immune infiltration was evaluated, and a protein–protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed. In vitro experiments, including Western blotting, CCK-8 assays, and flow cytometry, were conducted to validate the bioinformatics findings.ResultsBioinformatics analysis revealed significantly elevated CDK9 expression in AML samples, which correlated with poor patient prognosis. Functional enrichment analysis indicated that CDK9 is involved in key pathways related to cell proliferation, differentiation, and the tumor microenvironment. Moreover, the study observed a strong correlation between CDK9 expression and altered immune cell infiltration, suggesting a potential role in immune evasion. In vitro experiments confirmed that CDK9 overexpression promoted AML cell proliferation and inhibited apoptosis. Additionally, CDK9 showed a strong correlation with epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related proteins, suggesting a potential role in AML progression and the EMT process.ConclusionsThis study demonstrates that CDK9 is a potential prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target in AML.

"High temperature causes several biological changes in wheat and results in yield reduction. Use of DNA marker linked to heat resistance/tolerance attributes accelerates selection and expedites breeding for heat tolerance. In this study, heat-tolerant wheat var. Halna and heat-susceptible wheat var. K9006 were selected as donor and recipient, respectively, after phenotyping. In the F2population, heat tolerant and susceptible Lines were bulked for the bulk segregant analysis. Parental polymorphism was studied by 32 RAPD primers, of which only six primers showed polymorphism between parents and used for the confirmation of F1crosses. The 10 tolerant and 10 susceptible F2plants (F1(K 9006 × Halna) were bulked and the tolerant bulk showing maximum membrane stability index (53.48%) and chlorophyll content (2.16 mg/g) were used for the molecular study. The RAPD primer (OPE 09) segregated susceptible and tolerant bulks and an unique band of 700 bp was observed in the tolerant parent (var. Halna) and the tolerant bulk was cloned and sequenced. A SCAR marker was developed from the cloned bands, and a primer pair was designed. The designed SCAR marker was successfully validated on the randomly selected heat-susceptible and heat-tolerant wheat varieties. The obtained sequence from the cloned unique bands of the tolerant bulk can be further utilized via bioinformatics tools. Further physicochemical, secondary structure prediction, transmembrane domain, tertiary structure prediction, active site prediction, and molecular docking were performed to analyze and elucidate the cloned sequence. The findings indicate that the identified sequence might be related to a specific biochemical pathway involving tolerance to heat stress in wheat.",Bioinformatics,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s44314-025-00030-9,1
"Stress-related disorders, including major depressive disorder (MDD), bipolar disorder (BD), and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), share complex biological mechanisms and overlapping symptoms, posing challenges for diagnosis and treatment. This in silico study aimed to identify metabolomic patterns and explore dysfunctional metabolic pathways that are common and specific within a transdiagnostic psychiatric sample. A systematic review was conducted to identify metabolomic studies using mass spectrometry on blood samples from patients with MDD, BD, and PTSD. Study screening was performed using Rayyan, and metabolite codes were retrieved from the HMDB and ChEBI databases. Identified metabolites were classified using the R software, and metabolic pathway enrichment analysis was conducted in MetaboAnalyst. Thirteen eligible studies were identified, reporting 583 metabolites. Among these, four metabolites—arginine, inosine, 5-oxoproline (5-OP), and pyruvic acid—were consistently altered across disorders. Bioinformatics analysis revealed key metabolic pathways primarily related to amino acid, energy, carbohydrate, and lipid metabolism, suggesting shared biological mechanisms. These findings reinforce the transdiagnostic nature of metabolic dysfunction in psychiatric disorders and may contribute to the development of personalized therapeutic strategies and biomarker panels for improved diagnosis and treatment.",Bioinformatics,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00210-025-04542-9,1
"Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a life-threatening lung condition characterized by severe inflammation, immune dysregulation, and oxidative stress, leading to high mortality (30–40%). This study explores the involvement of MAM-related genes in ARDS pathogenesis through bioinformatics and experimental validation.  Publicly available RNA-sequencing data from ARDS and control samples were analyzed to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Functional enrichment, gene set variation analysis (GSVA), and weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) were performed to explore pathway alterations and hub gene interactions. Immune cell infiltration analysis was conducted using CIBERSORT. Candidate MAM-related genes were validated in a Poly I: C-induced ARDS mouse model and MLE-12 murine lung epithelial cells. The mouse model was assessed for lung histopathology, wet-to-dry lung weight ratio, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) inflammatory cytokine levels (IL-1β and TNF-α), and lung injury scores. MLE-12 cells were treated with Poly I: C, and cell viability, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release, and apoptosis were evaluated. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis and drug prediction were used to identify potential therapeutic targets.  A total of 3152 DEGs including 1549 upregulated and 1603 downregulated were identified in ARDS samples. Pathway analysis revealed autophagy suppression and immune activation, with 14 immune cell types significantly elevated in ARDS patients. Experimental validation confirmed that Poly I: C-induced ARDS mice exhibited severe lung injury and increased inflammatory reaction, while Poly I: C-treated MLE-12 cells showed increased cytotoxicity and LDH release.ZMAT2andHBBwere identified as key MAM-related hub genes, withZMAT2positively associated with disease progression andHBBnegatively correlating with lung injury severity. Drug prediction analysis identified 29 pharmacological agents interacting withHBB, suggesting therapeutic potential.  This study identifiesZMAT2andHBBas key MAM-related genes contributing to ARDS pathogenesis, with potential diagnostic and therapeutic applications. The integration of bioinformatics with in vivo and in vitro validation provides novel insights into ARDS molecular mechanisms.

"BackgroundAcute myocardial infarction (AMI) is the primary cause of cardiac mortality worldwide. However, myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury (MIRI) following reperfusion therapy is common in AMI, causing myocardial damage and affecting the patient’s prognosis. Presently, there are no effective treatments available for MIRI.MethodsWe performed a comprehensive bioinformatics analysis using three GEO datasets on differentially expressed genes, including gene ontology (GO), pathway enrichment analyses, and protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis. Cytoscape and LASSO methods were employed to identify novel regulator genes for ischemia-reperfusion (I/R). Notably, gene S100A9 was identified as a potential regulator of I/R. Additionally, clinical sample datasets were analyzed to prove the expression and mechanism of S100A9 and its down genes in I/R. The correlation of S100A9 with cardiac events was also examined to enhance the reliability of our results.ResultsWe identified 135 differential genes between the peripheral blood of 47 controls and 92 I/R patients. S100A9 was distinguished as a novel regulator gene of I/R with diagnostic potential. RT-qPCR test demonstrated significant upregulation of S100A9 in I/R. We also verified that S100A9 expression strongly correlates with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and MIRI.ConclusionThis study confirms that S100A9 is a key regulator of I/R progression and may participate in ischemia-reperfusion injury by upregulating RAGE /NFKB-NLRP3 activation. Elevated S100A9 levels may serve as a marker for identifying high-risk MIRI patients, especially those with coronary artery no-reflow (CNR), who might benefit from targeted therapeutic interventions. Furthermore, Peripheral blood S100A9 in AMI represents a new therapeutic target for preventing MIRI.",Bioinformatics,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s41065-025-00397-5,1
"BackgroundDetection of ovarian cancer at early stages is well known to impact the survival rate significantly, but the sensitivity of current diagnostic techniques is low. Thus, there is a need to develop new diagnostic techniques. This study aimed to analyze an existing gene expression dataset and identify potential molecular biomarkers using bioinformatics, statistical, and machine learning techniques.ResultsGene expression datasets were retrieved from the ArrayExpress database and analyzed to identify differentially expressed genes using the limma package in R. Feature selection using the Boruta algorithm yielded 14 potential biomarker genes, including 8 upregulated (HOXB2, FOLR1, NEK2, KRT18, WFDC2, EHF, KLK6, CELSR1) and 6 downregulated (SGK1, CLSTN2, STAR, OSR2, FOXL2, ADAMTS5) candidates. Functional annotation revealed that many of these dysregulated genes are involved in biological processes such as cell–cell adhesion and response to mineralocorticoid corticosterone mechanisms known to influence cancer progression through modulation of inflammation, cellular stress, and the tumor microenvironment. A machine learning-based predictive model developed using these 14 genes achieved an accuracy of 89.5% on the test dataset.CELSR1,SGK1, andSTARemerged as novel molecular biomarkers among the identified genes. Progression-free survival analysis using the Kaplan–Meier Plotter indicated a significant association between these biomarkers and poor prognosis, suggesting their potential role in disease progression.ConclusionsThe gene set identified in this study shows promise as diagnostic biomarkers for ovarian cancer.

"Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a degenerative illness that accounts for the common type of dementia among adults over the age of 65. Despite extensive studies on the pathogenesis of the disease, early diagnosis of AD is still debatable. In this research, we performed bioinformatics approaches on the AD-related E-MTAB 6094 dataset to uncover new potential biomarkers for AD diagnosis. To achieve this, we performed in-depth in silico assays, including differentially expressed genes analysis, weighted gene co-expression network analyses, module-trait association analyses, gene ontology and pathway enrichment analyses, and hub genes network analyses. Finally, the expression of the identified candidate genes was evaluated in AD patients PBMC samples by qRT-PCR. Through computational analyses, we found that RN7SK LncRNA and its co-expressed genes of TNF, TNFAIP3, CCLT3, and FLT3 are from key genes in AD development that are associated with inflammatory responses. Our experimental validation revealed that RN7SK LncRNA and TNF were substantially up-regulated in AD samples (P= 0.006 andP= 0.023, respectively). Whereas, TNFAIP3 expression was significantly decreased (P= 0.016). However, the expression of CCL3 and FLT3 did not differ significantly between two groups (P= 0.396 andP= 0.521, respectively).

"Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), the seventh most common cancer globally, has not yet seen an exploration of the specific role of hsa-miR-103a-3p. This study employs integrated bioinformatics analysis to investigate the function, regulatory patterns, and prognostic significance of hsa-miR-103a-3p in HNSCC. The Kaplan-Meier database was used for pan-cancer prognostic analysis of hsa-miR-103a-3p. Expression significance was assessed using the dbDEMC and GSE124566 dataset from GEO. TargetScan, RNA22, miRDB, and miRWalk identified potential targets, while GEPIA 2.0 provided differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Functional and pathway enrichment analyses were conducted using ShinyGO and KOBAS. Elevated hsa-miR-103a-3p expression correlated with poor overall survival and was upregulated in HNSCC tissues. Integration of four target prediction tools yielded 297 candidate genes. Among them,HOXD10,HMGA2, andTHY1showed the highest expression, whereasUBL3,AMOT, andPDK4displayed low levels.UBE2Q1,ZFPM2, andATXN1demonstrated the strongest accessibility to hsa-miR-103a-3p binding. Network analysis revealed interactions with transcription factors and tumor-related genes, while enrichment highlighted involvement in upstream regulators and downstream cancer-associated pathways. This study identified 297 target genes and clarified the regulatory role of hsa-miR-103a-3p through interaction networks, transcription factor associations, and pathway enrichment. These findings suggest a potential oncogenic role for hsa-miR-103a-3p in modulating the cAMP signaling pathway, proteoglycans in cancer, and related mechanisms, thereby linking its molecular regulation to poor prognosis and potential therapeutic targeting in HNSCC.",Bioinformatics,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1038/s41598-025-26188-6,1

"Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a non-communicable disease (NCD) with high morbidity and mortality, commonly observed worldwide. Understanding its molecular mechanisms and identifying potential therapeutic targets are crucial for disease screening, diagnosis, and treatment. In this study, we conducted a meta-analysis of multiple genome-wide association studies (GWASs) to identify genetic variants associated with AAA and explored the functional implications of these variants in disease pathology. We identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs) based on significant single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) and transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) analyses. Using these DEGs, we constructed an AAA-related protein-protein interaction (PPI) network and prioritized key genes for further analysis. Furthermore, we performed drug repurposing by identifying drug-gene and drug-protein interactions in existing databases and validated potential candidates through molecular docking. Our findings reveal 42 novel disease-associated SNPs and 52 previously unreported disease-related genes. Some residual confounding factors cannot be fully ruled out and may represent a limitation of our study. However, it is worth noting that only a minority of SNPs exhibited heterogeneity. Functional pathways analysis highlighted key processes, including lipid and cholesterol metabolism, tissue remodeling, and acetylcholine activation. We identified 74 DEGs through eQTL and TWAS analyses, with PPI network analysis highlighting CD40 and LRP1 as key proteins. Drug repurposing and molecular docking suggested abciximab and paclitaxel as potential therapeutic agents targeting CD40, while ivermectin emerged as a strong candidate for LRP1 binding. In conclusion, our integrative bioinformatics frameworks links genomics and transcriptomics with network biology and structural modeling, providing valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms of AAA and potential therapeutic strategies.",Bioinformatics,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1038/s41598-025-07989-1,1
"BackgroundPolycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a reproductive endocrine disorder. The specific molecular mechanism of PCOS remains unclear. The aim of this study was to apply a bioinformatics approach to reveal related pathways or genes involved in the development of PCOS.MethodsThe next-generation sequencing (NGS) dataset GSE199225 was downloaded from the gene expression omnibus (GEO) database and NGS dataset analyzed is obtained from in vitro culture of PCOS patients’ muscle cells and muscle cells of healthy lean control women. Differentially expressed gene (DEG) analysis was performed using DESeq2. The g:Profiler was utilized to analyze the gene ontology (GO) and REACTOME pathways of the differentially expressed genes. A protein–protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed and module analysis was performed using HiPPIE and cytoscape. The miRNA-hub gene regulatory network and TF-hub gene regulatory network were constructed. The hub genes were validated by using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis.ResultsWe have identified 957 DEG in total, including 478 upregulated genes and 479 downregulated gene. GO terms and REACTOME pathways illustrated that DEG were significantly enriched in regulation of molecular function, developmental process, interferon signaling and platelet activation, signaling, and aggregation. The top 5 upregulated hub genes including HSPA5, PLK1, RIN3, DBN1, and CCDC85B and top 5 downregulated hub genes including DISC1, AR, MTUS2, LYN, and TCF4 might be associated with PCOS. The hub gens of HSPA5 and KMT2A, together with corresponding predicted miRNAs (e.g., hsa-mir-34b-5p and hsa-mir-378a-5p), and HSPA5 and TCF4 together with corresponding predicted TF (e.g., RCOR3 and TEAD4) were found to be significantly correlated with PCOS.ConclusionsThese study uses of bioinformatics analysis of NGS data to obtain hub genes and key signaling pathways related to PCOS and its associated complications.

"Ulcerative colitis (UC) and psoriasis are highly correlated clinically; however, it is unclear whether they have a common pathophysiological mechanism. The purpose of this study is to investigate the important molecules and pathways that mediate the coexistence of UC and psoriasis through quantitative bioinformatics analysis of public RNA-sequencing databases. The UC (GSE38713) and psoriasis (GSE30999) datasets were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. Differentially expressed genes were analysed using the “limma” package and their biological functions were investigated using Gene Ontology and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes. The Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes database was used to create the protein–protein interaction (PPI) network, which was visualised by Cytoscape. The CytoHubba plugin was used to select the hub genes. The hub genes of psoriasis and UC were verified in GSE75214, GSE78097, GSE14905, and GSE87466. The predicted value of the hub gene was evaluated by the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC). Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) and immune infiltration were performed for the hub genes. Finally, we performed transcription factor (TF)-gene interaction network analysis, TF-miRNA co-regulation network analysis and candidate drug prediction. A total of 114 genes (89 ascending genes and 25 descending genes) with similar expression trends between UC and psoriasis were identified. Enrichment analysis revealed that the two signaling pathways were primarily related to immune and inflammatory responses. PPI network screened 13 hub genes (IL-1B, CXCL10, TLR2, CD274, CXCR2, CXCL9, MMP9, CXCL1, CASP1, IL-7R, IL-1RN, CCL18 and LCN2). Using NetworkAnalyst, we constructed a co-regulatory network diagram of TF-gene and TF-miRNA. Finally, diacerein was predicted to be effective in the treatment of UC and psoriasis.

"BackgroundIschemic stroke (IS) is a common cerebrovascular disease. Although the formation of atherosclerosis, which is closely related to oxidative stress (OS), is associated with stroke-related deaths. However, the role of OS in IS is unknown.MethodsOS-related key genes were obtianed by overlapping the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between IS and normal control (NC) specimens, IS-related genes, and OS-related genes. Then, we investigated the mechanism of action of key genes. Subsequently, protein–protein interaction (PPI) network and machine learning algorithms were utilized to excavate feature genes. In addition, the network between feature genes and microRNAs (miRNAs) was established to investigate the regulatory mechanism of feature genes. Finally, quantitative PCR (qPCR) was utilized to validate the expression of feature genes with blood specimens.ResultsA total of 42 key genes related to OS were acquired. Enrichment analysis indicated that the key genes were associated with oxidative stress, reactive oxygen species, lipid and atherosclerosis, and cell migration-related pathways. Then, 6 feature genes (HSPA8,NCF2,FOS,KLF4,THBS1, andHSPA1A) related to OS were identified for IS. Besides, 6 feature genes and 255 miRNAs were utilized to establish a feature genes-miRNA network which contained 261 nodes and 277 edges.

Additionally,HSPA8expression was significantly decreased in the IS specimens, which was consistent with the findings of the GEO database analysis.ConclusionIn conclusion, 6 feature genes (HSPA8,NCF2,FOS,KLF4,THBS1, andHSPA1A) related to OS were mined by bioinformatics analysis, which might provide a new insights into the evaluation and treatment of IS.Clinical trial number: Not applicable.",Bioinformatics,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12868-024-00921-9,1
"Approximately 1.5% of individuals with hemoglobin disorders carry the β-thalassemia gene variant, impacting around 40,000 newborns annually. Given the incomplete understanding of β-thalassemia pathogenesis, there is an urgent need to identify effective biomarkers to advance research, diagnosis, and treatment. This study aims to identify potential biomarkers for two key purposes: (1) diagnosing transfusion-dependent β-thalassemia (TDT) and (2) detecting iron overload complications, with a focus on functional markers that reflect iron metabolism dysregulation in TDT. This study integrates transcriptomic data from the Genome Sequence Archive dataset (CRA003639) with bioinformatics analysis to identify potential biomarkers associated with β-thalassemia. Subsequently, Hbb-bs and Hbb-bt double knockout mice were used to establish a β-thalassemia model, while C57BL/6JCya mice served as the control group, to validate the identified biomarkers through animal experiments. Seventeen reliable cell subsets were identified through rigorous annotation and screening. Quantitative analysis revealed a decreased proportion of immune cells (natural killer [NK] cells, T cells, macrophages, neutrophils, and monocytes) and an increased proportion of erythroid cells in the β-thalassemia group. Cell subset analysis focused on subsets that closely communicated with erythroid cells. Enrichment analysis of driver genes in these subsets revealed iron metabolism–related pathways inErythroid_02andErythroid_03, and a ferroptosis-related pathway inErythroid_05.Thalassemia model mice exhibited stronger iron ion fluorescence signals in primary hepatocytes, increased levels of total iron, Fe2+, and Fe3+in liver tissue, and decreased serum iron (SI) levels, indicating iron metabolism disorders. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) results showed differential gene expression, withBCL2L1,Hepb1, andPrdx6downregulated andSpta1andSncaupregulated in the TDT model group.

"BackgroundHuman cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a herpesvirus that can infect various cell types and modulate host gene expression and immune response. It has been associated with the pathogenesis of various cancers, but its molecular mechanisms remain elusive.MethodsWe comprehensively analyzed the expression of HCMV pathway genes across 26 cancer types using the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and The Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) databases. We also used bioinformatics tools to study immune invasion and tumor microenvironment in pan-cancer. Cox regression and machine learning were used to analyze prognostic genes and their relationship with drug sensitivity.ResultsWe found that HCMV pathway genes are widely expressed in various cancers. Immune infiltration and the tumor microenvironment revealed that HCMV is involved in complex immune processes. We obtained prognostic genes for 25 cancers and significantly found 23 key genes in the HCMV pathway, which are significantly enriched in cellular chemotaxis and synaptic function and may be involved in disease progression. Notably, CaM family genes were up-regulated and AC family genes were down-regulated in most tumors. These hub genes correlate with sensitivity or resistance to various drugs, suggesting their potential as therapeutic targets.ConclusionsOur study has revealed the role of the HCMV pathway in various cancers and provided insights into its molecular mechanism and therapeutic significance.

"This study aimed to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying ulcerative colitis (UC)-associated colorectal cancer (CRC) development and identify potential therapeutic targets through integrated multi-omics analysis. Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis, combined with bioinformatics approaches including differential gene expression analysis, protein-protein interaction network construction, gene set enrichment analysis, and single-cell RNA sequencing, was employed. Data were obtained from GEO, TCGA, and genome-wide association study (GWAS) databases. Drug prediction and molecular docking were performed using DSigDB and AutoDockTools. A total of 48 shared genes were identified between UC and CRC, with MMP1 emerging as a significant protective factor (OR = 0.766; 95% CI = 0.593–0.989,P= 0.041). MMP1 demonstrated strong diagnostic potential (AUC = 0.927, 95% CI = 0.895–0.959) and was functionally associated with immune regulation and metabolic pathways. Single-cell analysis revealed predominant MMP1 expression in fibroblasts and immune cells, while immune infiltration analysis showed significant correlations with CD8⁺ T cells and NK cells. Mediation MR analysis indicated that 63.33% of MMP1’s protective effect was mediated through naive-mature B cells. Drug prediction identified ilomastat as a potential MMP1 inhibitor with strong binding affinity (binding energy = –7.17 kcal/mol). These findings provide evidence for MMP1’s protective role in UC-associated CRC through immune microenvironment modulation, highlighting its potential as a diagnostic biomarker and therapeutic target. The identification of ilomastat as a potential MMP1 inhibitor offers new avenues for targeted therapy in inflammation-associated cancers.",Bioinformatics,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1038/s41417-025-00917-5,1
"PurposeThis study aims to explore the causal association between members of the cathepsin family and breast cancer subtypes, with a focus on their expression profiles, prognostic significance, and potential molecular mechanisms in HER2-positive and HER2-negative breast cancer. Additionally, the study includes preliminary in vitro cell experiments to validate the functional relevance of key genes.MethodsThis study employs the two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) method to analyze the causal relationship between 10 members of the cathepsin family (CTSB, CTSE, CTSF, CTSG, CTSH, CTSL1, CTSL2, CTSO, CTSS, CTSZ) and breast cancer risk. Sensitivity analyses, including MR-Egger, Cochran’s Q test, and MR-PRESSO, are used to validate the robustness of the results. Additionally, the study integrates differential gene expression analysis, prognostic impact analysis, single-cell analysis, protein-protein interaction (PPI) network construction, and targeted cell experiments (qRT-PCR for gene expression, CTSO overexpression model construction, CCK-8 proliferation assay, and wound healing migration assay) to systematically investigate the role of cathepsins in breast cancer.ResultsMR analysis identified significant associations between CTSE and CTSO expression with breast cancer risk. Elevated CTSE expression was positively associated with both HER2-positive (OR = 1.108,P= 0.022) and HER2-negative (OR = 1.099,P= 0.009) breast cancer risk. In contrast, CTSO expression was inversely associated with HER2-negative breast cancer risk (OR = 0.913,P= 0.037). Differential expression analysis confirmed that CTSE was overexpressed in HER2-positive tumors, while CTSO was underexpressed across breast cancer subtypes. Prognostic analysis showed that high CTSE expression was linked to a favorable prognosis in HER2-positive breast cancer patients treated with chemotherapy, whereas high CTSO expression correlated with improved prognosis in HER2-negative patients. Single-cell analysis revealed that CTSO was highly expressed in immune cells and fibroblasts, while CTSE was mainly localized to cancerous epithelial cells. PPI and functional enrichment analyses suggested that CTSE is involved in lysosomal and protein digestion pathways, whereas CTSO is implicated in immune regulation and antigen processing. Cellular experiments revealed that qRT-PCR did not detect quantifiable levels of CTSE in breast cancer cell lines, while CTSO exhibited low expression across all breast cancer cell lines. After overexpressing CTSO in MDA-MB-231 cells, CCK-8 assays showed a significant reduction in cell proliferation, and wound healing assays demonstrated a marked inhibition of cell migration.ConclusionThis study provides multi-layered evidence for the association between members of the cathepsin family (particularly CTSE and CTSO) and breast cancer subtypes through MR analysis, bioinformatics validation, and cellular experiments. The findings highlight the potential of these markers as subtype-specific biomarkers for precision diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis evaluation in breast cancer. These results deepen our understanding of the biological mechanisms underlying breast cancer and offer both experimental and theoretical support for the development of novel therapeutic strategies targeting the cathepsin family.",Bioinformatics,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12672-025-03787-3,1
"Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is characterized by glucose intolerance during pregnancy, and emerging evidence implicates dysregulated iron metabolism as a critical modulator of its pathogenesis. Ferroptosis, an iron-mediated cell death, has recently been studied in GDM, with research beginning to unravel the connection between iron-induced oxidative stress and placental dysfunction. In this study, we employed datasets from the Gene Expression Omnibus database to identify markers of ferroptosis that are associated with GDM. A total of 57 differentially expressed genes related to ferroptosis were identified. Feature selection was performed using machine learning approaches, including Boruta, Random Forest, and LASSO regression, to pinpoint the most critical genes. Among them, GPX3 emerged as the central biomarker linked to ferroptosis in GDM. We further validated GPX3 expression across various placental cell types using single cell RNA sequencing data. Further CIBERSORT analysis determined a significant association between GPX3 and several immune cell populations, including macrophages, B cells, monocytes, and T cells. Finally, mRNA expression of GPX3 was experimentally validated in placental samples from GDM patients, where it was found to correlate with a reduced sTFR/ferritin ratio, suggesting disrupted iron homeostasis. In conclusion, GPX3 is identified as a crucial immuno-ferroptotic biomarker in GDM, with potential diagnostic value. Integrating bioinformatics, machine learning, and clinical validation, this study highlights the role of GPX3 at the intersection of immune infiltration and iron metabolism, offering new insights for future diagnostic and therapeutic strategies in GDM.",Bioinformatics,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11030-025-11373-6,1
"BackgroundHeart failure (HF) and COVID-19 are distinct but serious conditions with overlapping features such as systemic inflammation and multiorgan involvement. Both may share underlying molecular mechanisms, but the common genetic contributors remain poorly understood. This study aimed to identify shared key genes involved in HF and COVID-19 using integrative bioinformatics analysis.MethodsTwo transcriptomic datasets GSE76701 (HF myocardial tissue) and GSE190496 (COVID-19 lung tissue)—were retrieved from the GEO database. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified using the limma package. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) and protein–protein interaction (PPI) network analysis were used to identify hub genes. Functional enrichment (GO, KEGG, GSEA), immune infiltration (CIBERSORT), disease association (CTD), and miRNA prediction (TargetScan) analyses were also performed.ResultsA total of 511 overlapping DEGs were identified. Enrichment analyses revealed involvement of pathways such as mTOR, insulin, and thyroid hormone signaling. WGCNA and PPI network analysis identified five core genes, including RPS27A and PPP2R1A, both of which were significantly upregulated in HF and COVID-19 samples. Immune infiltration analysis revealed increased macrophage fractions. miRNA predictions suggested PPP2R1A is potentially regulated by miR-497-5p, miR-15b-5p, and miR-15a-5p.ConclusionRPS27A and PPP2R1A may serve as common molecular regulators in HF and COVID-19. These findings offer potential cross-disease biomarkers and therapeutic targets for conditions driven by inflammation and immune dysregulation.",Bioinformatics,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s13019-025-03634-0,1
"BackgroundIn July 2022, a newly emerged viral infection called Langya virus, a type ofHenipavirusidentified in febrile patients in China and closely linked to two otherhenipaviruses(Hendra and Nipah) was considered a potential threat and can lead to the endemic situation. At present, no appropriate vaccine exists. Therefore, this investigation aims to design a multi-epitope vaccine against this infection via an integrated bioinformatics and immunoinformatics approach focusing on attachment glycoprotein and fusion protein.ResultsA total of 26 immunodominant epitopes were carefully chosen for vaccine formulation grounded on their antigenic, nonallergenic and nontoxic features and linked via precise linkers, along with HIV-TAT peptide, PADRE epitope and 6 × His-tag. The intended vaccine is forecast to be immunodominant, with broader population coverage encouraging physicochemical features and highly soluble. The 3D structure was anticipated and verified, and a docking study with toll-like receptors (TLR2, TLR3, TLR8 and TLR9) indicates significant binding with TLR3 and TLR9 based on the highest molecular interaction and high binding affinity score of − 25.2 and − 24.2 kcal mol−1. NMA analysis revealed that vaccines with TLR3 and TLR9 have eigenvalues of 1.953251e−05 and 4.814201e−05, indicating proper molecular motion and flexibility. Further, the simulation (100 ns) showed constancy of complex (vaccine with TLR3 and TLR9). The generated immune activity indicates that the vaccines can trigger an intense immunological response. Furthermore, in silico cloning ensured a significant expression, followed by CAI values of 1 and GC (53.78%) content.ConclusionThis study successfully designed a promising vaccine with strong immune activity. The vaccine revealed strong activity towards TLR3 and TLR9, with binding affinity of − 25.2 and − 24.2 kcal mol−1, and over 100-ns simulation demonstrated minor deviation followed by the range of RMSD value. Further, the immune stimulation and cloning demonstrated potent activity and suggested the vaccine is able to evoke immune activity. However, experimental and clinical analyses are essential to authenticate these findings.",Bioinformatics,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s43094-025-00815-5,1
"BackgroundHepatocellular carcinoma is one of the most common and malignant tumors worldwide. Although aloe-emodin (AE), a pure natural drug, can effectively kill hepatocellular carcinoma cells, its internal molecular mechanism has not been fully elucidated. In this study, the anti-hepatocellular carcinoma targets of AE were predicted using network pharmacology and bioinformatics.MethodsThe differentially expressed genes between hepatocellular carcinoma and normal tissues were first identified and then further intersected with the potential pharmacological target genes of AE for subsequent analysis. Moreover, the potential targets of AE were enriched and analyzed to identify potential downstream pathways. The binding ability and interaction between the above drug targets and AE were analyzed by molecular docking. The prognostic model of hepatocellular carcinoma was subsequently constructed via univariate Cox regression analysis, LASSO regression analysis and multivariate Cox regression analysis. Finally, the potential targets that can stably bind to AE were further screened through molecular dynamics simulation. Finally, we validated the potential utility of AE in treating hepatocellular carcinoma through in vitro experiments.ResultsAfter 90 target genes related to AE were crossed with hepatocellular carcinoma differential genes, 13 cross genes were obtained. The above 13 genes might act on hepatocellular carcinoma through the following pathways: p53 signaling pathway, cell cycle, cellular sense, mismatch repair, apoptosis-multiple specifications, base example repair and DNA replication. Molecular docking revealed that the combination of the BAX, FASN, CDK1, PCNA, CLIC1, VWF, RAN, FOXM1, TGM3, CANT1, and NSMCE2 proteins with AE was relatively stable. A 4-gene prognostic model was further constructed. The area under the curve (AUC) values of the 1-year, 3-year and 5-year survival rates from the ROC curve were 0.809, 0.673 and 0.641, respectively. Molecular dynamics analysis revealed that CDK1 and PCNA were the most stable binding targets among the above proteins. CCK8 and wound healing assays revealed that AE inhibited the proliferation and migration of hepatocellular carcinoma cells at increasing concentrations. Western blot experiments revealed that AE achieved therapeutic effects on hepatocellular carcinoma by promoting apoptosis of hepatocellular carcinoma cells.ConclusionsBased on network pharmacology, bioinformatics, molecular dynamics simulation, and in vitro experimental verification, we found that AE achieved a therapeutic effect on hepatocellular carcinoma by promoting apoptosis of hepatocellular carcinoma cells.",Bioinformatics,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12672-025-02215-w,1
"BackgroundThe global energy crisis, driven by economic growth and the increasing demand for energy, highlights the urgency of searching for alternative energy sources to mitigate environmental pollution and climate change. β-Glucosidases act in the final step of the enzymatic hydrolysis of cellulose, cleaving the β-1,4-glycosidic bonds in cellobiose to produce second-generation ethanol. However, these enzymes are easily inhibited by glucose, their final product, which limits the production of this biofuel. Genetic engineering combined with bioinformatics tools can improve key enzymatic characteristics, such as catalytic activity and glucose tolerance, in a more precise, faster, and cost-effective manner compared to traditional methods. In this work, a variant of a β-glucosidase from the GH1 family, isolated from the microbial community of Amazonian soil (Brazil), with enhanced catalytic activity and improved for glucose retroinhibition, was developed.ResultsBioinformatics analyses suggested the substitution of tryptophan at position 404 with leucine. The produced variant (W404L) was expressed inEscherichia coliand showed activity 3.2 times higher in the presence of glucose than the non-mutated control. Moreover, the partially purified mutated variant of β-glucosidase exhibited a 26-fold increase in catalytic activity compared to the original form of the enzyme. The results confirmed that the mutation proposed by computational analyses had a significant impact on enzyme catalytic activity and glucose retroinhibition.ConclusionsThis new variant may become a promising alternative to reduce the costs of enzyme cocktails used in the hydrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass used as a raw material in the production of second-generation ethanol.Graphical Abstract",Bioinformatics,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s13068-025-02643-4,1
"BackgroundColorectal cancer (CRC) ranks third in global cancer diagnoses and is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths. Identifying novel therapeutic targets and effective prognostic markers is crucial to improve CRC outcomes. This study aimed to investigate the role of FAM3B in relation to clinicopathological features, prognosis, tumor microenvironment, and immune infiltration of CRC.MethodsWe obtained data from bioinformatics databases, immunohistochemical experiments, and two-sample Mendelian randomization analyses. Differential expression analysis, survival analysis, Cox regression, and tumor microenvironment/immune infiltration evaluation were performed. FAM3B expression patterns were validated by immunohistochemistry. The causal relationship betweenFAM3Band CRC risk was explored using SNP data obtained from IEU GWAS and FinnGen by calculating the MR-Egger regression, weighted median, and inverse-variance weighting estimations.ResultsFAM3Bwas significantly upregulated in CRC tissues compared to normal tissues (p< 0.001). HighFAM3Bexpression was associated with poor prognosis (HR: 1.59, 95% CI 1.00–2.54,p< 0.05), advanced tumor stages, and metastasis. Patients with highFAM3Bexpression had lower overall survival rates compared to those with low expression. HighFAM3Blevels were correlated with increased tumor cell purity and specific immune infiltration, including higher levels of M1 macrophages and lower levels of CD8+ T cells, resting NK cells, and monocytes (p< 0.05). The multivariate Cox regression analysis confirmedFAM3Bas an independent prognostic factor. Mendelian randomization analysis indicated a causal relationship betweenFAM3Band CRC risk (IVW method OR = 1.07, 95% CI 1.00–1.14,p= 0.035).ConclusionHighFAM3Bexpression levels are correlated with poor prognosis and advanced tumor stages in CRC patients, likely influencing CRC development by regulating the tumor microenvironment characteristics.

"Gallbladder Cancer (GBC) is a lethal malignancy with limited treatment options and poor prognosis. Recent studies have emphasized the role of ferroptosis, a regulated form of cell death, in various cancers, including GBC. We applied bioinformatics methodologies on four GBC datasets to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs). An intersection of DEGs from the four datasets with ferroptosis and GBC-associated genes was done to identify key ferroptosis-related genes in GBC. GSVA pathway enrichment analysis and immune cell infiltration assessment were conducted to explore their functional roles and interactions. Seven ferroptosis-related genes, EZH2, MUC1, PVT1, GOT1, CDO1, LIFR, and TFAP2A, were identified to be related to GBC. These genes were associated with vital signaling pathways like the G2/M checkpoint and DNA repair and showed significant correlations with immune cell infiltration in GBC. Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve analysis revealed their high diagnostic potential, with Area Under the Curve (AUC) values ranging from 0.796 to 0.953. Our findings underscore the pivotal role of ferroptosis in GBC and the potential of ferroptosis-related genes as diagnostic biomarkers.

"BackgroundGalangin, a flavonoid compound, is derived fromAlpinia officinarumHance. Previous studies have shown that galangin can inhibit the proliferation of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but its mechanism is still unclear. This study aims to investigate the potential targets and molecular mechanisms of galangin on HCC through network pharmacology, bioinformatics, molecular docking, and experimental in vitro validation.MethodsIn this study, network pharmacology was used to investigate the targets and mechanisms of galangin in the treatment of HCC. AutoDockTools software was used to simulate and calculate the binding of galangin to its core targets. GO and KEGG enrichment analyses were conducted in the DAVID database to explore the main biological functions and signaling pathways impacted by galangin intervention. In addition, bioinformatics was applied to examine the correlation between the differential expressions of the anti-HCC core targets of galangin and the survival of patients with HCC. Finally, the findings obtained from network pharmacology and bioinformatics were verified in cell experiments.ResultsA total of 67 overlapping target genes of galangin and HCC were identified. Through the analysis of the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network, 10 hub genes with the highest degree of freedom were identified, including SRC, ESR1, MMP9, CDK4, CCNB1, MMP2, CDK2, CDK1, CHK1, and PLK1. These genes were found to be closely related to the degradation of the extracellular matrix, signal transduction, and the cell cycle. GO and KEGG enrichment analyses revealed that galangin exerts an anti-HCC role by affecting various signaling pathways, including the cell cycle, pathways in cancer, and the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway. The results of molecular docking indicated a significant interaction between galangin and CCNB1, CDK4, CDK1, and PLK1. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that CCNB1, CDK4, CDK1, and PLK1 were upregulated in the liver of patients with HCC at both the mRNA and protein levels. Flow cytometry analysis showed that galangin induced G0/G1 phase arrest and cell apoptosis in HepG2 and Huh7 cells.

"Knee osteoarthritis (KOA) is a common chronic joint disease globally. Synovial inflammation plays a pivotal role in its pathogenesis, preceding cartilage damage. Identifying biomarkers in osteoarthritic synovial tissues holds promise for early diagnosis and targeted interventions. Gene expression profiles were obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. Subsequent analyses included differential expression gene (DEG) analysis and weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) on the combined datasets. We performed functional enrichment analysis on the overlapping genes between DEGs and module genes and constructed a protein–protein interaction network. Using Cytoscape software, we identified hub genes related to the disease and conducted gene set enrichment analysis on these hub genes. The CIBERSORT algorithm was employed to evaluate the correlation between hub genes and the abundance of immune cells within tissues. Finally, Mendelian randomization analysis was utilized to assess the potential of these hub genes as biomarkers. We identified 46 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), comprising 20 upregulated and 26 downregulated genes. Using WGCNA, we constructed a gene co-expression network and selected the most relevant modules, resulting in 24 intersecting genes with the DEGs. KEGG enrichment analysis of the intersecting genes identified the IL-17 signaling pathway, associated with inflammation, as the most significant pathway. Cytoscape software was utilized to rank the candidate genes, with JUN, ATF3, FOSB, NR4A2, and IL6 emerging as the top five based on the Degree algorithm. A nomogram model incorporating these five genes, supported by ROC curve analysis, validated their diagnostic efficacy. Immune infiltration and correlation analysis revealed that macrophages were significantly associated with JUN (p< 0.01), FOSB (p< 0.01), and NR4A2 (p< 0.05). Additionally, T follicular helper cells showed significant associations with ATF3 (p< 0.05), FOSB (p< 0.05), and JUN (p< 0.05). Mendelian randomization analysis provided strong evidence linking JUN (IVW: OR = 0.910,p= 0.005) and IL6 (IVW: OR = 1.024,p= 0.026) with KOA.

"BackgroundPreeclampsia (PE) is a serious hypertensive complication during pregnancy characterized by immune dysregulation and vascular dysfunction, however, the precise molecular mechanisms and effective therapeutic strategies remain unclear. This study focused on identifying immune-related differentially expressed genes (IRDEGs) in PE, investigate their biological significance and regulatory networks, and establish robust diagnostic models through integrated bioinformatics and experimental analyses.MethodsGene expression data from the GSE75010 dataset were analyzed utilizing the R-based ""limma"" package to determine differentially expressed genes (DEGs), which were intersected with immune-related genes (IRGs) to obtain IRDEGs. Functional enrichment was assessed using Gene Ontology (GO), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), and Disease Ontology (DO) analyses. Hub genes were identified via Random Forest (RF) and LASSO regression algorithms, and their diagnostic performance was assessed via receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve evaluation in both training (GSE75010) and validation (GSE44711) cohorts. Immune cell composition and its association with hub genes were explored using CIBERSORT. Regulatory networks, including protein–protein interaction (PPI), mRNA-miRNA and mRNA-TF interactions, were constructed using ENCORI and CHIPBase databases. Analysis of potential pharmaceutical-gene interactions was performed via DGIdb platform interrogation, followed by experimental validation in placental tissue and trophoblast cells.ResultsWe identified 354 DEGs, including 49 IRDEGs (25 upregulated and 24 downregulated). Enrichment evaluation demonstrated that IRDEGs were associated with PI3K-AKT signaling, chemokine signaling, and cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction. DO analysis linked IRDEGs to PE, cardiovascular diseases, and reproductive disorders. Four hub genes (FLT1, PIK3CB, KLRD1, and APLN) were identified as PE biomarkers based on their connectivity in the PPI network and performance in machine learning models. The RF-based diagnostic model demonstrated excellent discrimination ability with AUCs of 0.9468 (training cohort) and 0.9844 (validation cohort). Immune infiltration analysis revealed higher levels of eosinophils, plasma cells, and CD8 + T cells in PE, while monocytes and M2 macrophages were reduced. Notably, hub genes showed distinct correlations with immune cell subtypes, such as the positive association observed between FLT1 and plasma cells, contrasting with the inverse relationship documented between APLN and CD8 + T cells. Network analysis identified 128 mRNA-miRNA and 31 mRNA-TF interaction pairs. Drug-gene interaction analysis showed cyclooxygenase inhibitors, such as aspirin, targeted APLN, while TNF-α inhibitors, such as etanercept, targeted KLRD1. Experimental validation confirmed consistent expression trends across clinical specimens and in vitro models: FLT1 and PIK3CB were significantly upregulated while KLRD1 and APLN were significantly downregulated in both preeclamptic placental tissues and hypoxia-exposed trophoblast cells.ConclusionsOur study identified four hub IRDEGs that may serve as potential diagnostic indicators and therapeutic targets for PE. These findings suggest an important role of immune dysregulation in PE pathogenesis and offer new perspectives for treatment strategies. By integrating computational predictions with experimental evidence, our work contributes to the foundation for future clinical applications, though further research including early-stage PE is needed to validate these observations.",Bioinformatics,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12884-025-08169-9,1
"The purpose of this study was to search for genes related to ros induced oxidative stress in osteoarthritis(OA) cartilage through bioinformatics analysis, and to verify the expression of related genes in articular cartilage of OA patients. OA expression data and ROS-related genes were downloaded from GEO (GSE51588, GSE117999) and Molecular Signatures Databases. The limma package in R language was used to screen differently expressed genes (DEGs) from the GEO databases. WGCNA analysis and Venn diagrams were employed to screen genes that were differentially expressed between OA and control samples and had strong correlations with ROS as candidate genes. DEGs were screened by GO and KEGG enrichment analysis, as well as protein-protein interaction (PPI) analysis. Besides, the software Cytoscape and database STRING were utilized to screen hub genes networks. The hub genes were confirmed by analysis of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve on the GSE51588 and GSE117999 databases. An artificial neural network model was constructed for the hub genes, and immune analysis was conducted using the ssGSEA algorithm. The expression of genes in OA and normal chondrocytes was verified through HE staining, immunohistochemistry, ROS detection, qRT-PCR and Western blotting test. This study identified five genes, including ALB, CDH1, HSPA8, HIST1H2BE and XDH, as hub genes. ROC curves, gene expression analysis, and artificial neural network diagrams indicated that ALB, HIST1H2BE and XDH had good diagnostic characteristics. GSEA showed that the XDH gene was significantly enriched in ROS pathways.

"Acute on chronic liver failure (ACLF) is a critical condition with a high mortality rate; however, the underlying mechanisms driving its progression remain poorly understood. Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), a recently discovered mechanism of cell death, may play a significant role in this process. Although NETs has been found in a variety of liver diseases, its specific mechanism in regulating the development of ACLF is not clear. Here, we sought to identify key NETs-related genes associate with ACLF. In this study, gene expression data from 24 whole blood samples, including 7 healthy donors and 17 ACLF patients, were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. Various bioinformatics analyses, including Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) and CIBERSORT, were performed to further analyse and compare the differential genes between patients with acute on chronic liver failure and healthy groups. Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes enrichment analyses were performed on the differential genes. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were analyzed against 69 known NETs-related genes, and a genetic diagnostic model for ACLF patients was established based on the analysis results. In addition, we used an unsupervised clustering method to assess immune infiltration and biological differences based on NETs-related genes. Finally, mice peripheral blood was collected for RT-qPCR verification. A total of 1694 DEGs were identified, and the biological functions and signaling pathways closely related to ACLF were monocyte differentiation and immune-metabolic processes. Twenty-seven expression modules were obtained by WGCNA, among which the ME pink and ME cyan module had the highest correlation with ACLF. The intersection of the results from both analyses with 69 NETs-related genes identified 13 key genes (FCAR, MMP9, ITGAM, DYSF, ALPL, MPO, MGAM, TLR8, BST1, ELANE, TLR4, TLR2, PADI4). Subsequently, CIBERSORT analysis revealed that immune cells, such as M0-type macrophages, activated memory CD4 T cells, and plasma cells, might play an important role in ACLF. Additionally, NETs-related genes were closely associated with immune infiltration. TLR4, BST1, MGAM, DYSF, and ALPL were significantly associated with immune cells. The results of RT-qPCR on mice peripheral blood showed that BST1 expression increased significantly. BST1 may be reliable marker for the diagnosis of ACLF patients, and these results may contribute to a better understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms of ACLF.",Bioinformatics,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1038/s41598-025-05792-6,1
"BackgroundOsteoarthritis (OA) is a degenerative joint disease marked by the breakdown of cartilage, where apoptosis plays a key role. Although apoptosis-related genes in OA have been studied, a detailed analysis of PANoptosis-related genes and the search for therapeutic drugs remains limited.MethodsWe performed a bioinformatics analysis combined with single-cell RNA sequencing to examine PANoptosis-related gene expression in OA cartilage.

"BackgroundThe intersection of aberrant iron metabolism and the rapidly advancing field of immunotherapy has emerged as a critical focus in breast cancer (BRCA) therapeutics. Ferroptosis, a distinct form of iron-dependent cell death driven by lipid peroxidation, has garnered increasing attention for its pivotal role in cancer progression.MethodsUtilizing extensive datasets from TCGA and GEO, this research extracted a wealth of biological data, including mRNA splicing indices, genomic aberrations, copy number variations (CNV), tumor mutational burden (TMB), and diverse clinical information. Through precise Lasso regression analysis, this research constructed a prognostic model that elucidates the molecular interactions of FRGs in BRCA. Concurrent co-expression network analyses were performed to explore the dynamic interplay between gene expression patterns and FRGs, revealing potential regulatory mechanisms.ResultsThis research analysis revealed significant overexpression of FRGs in high-risk BRCA samples, highlighting their prognostic relevance beyond traditional clinical parameters.

Candidate drugs were predicted using the Drug-Gene Interaction Database and validated through molecular docking. Twenty shared genes were identified through differential expression analysis and WGCNA. The toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling pathway was identified as a key pathway in CD-IS comorbidity. TLR2 and TLR8 were identified as core genes, with strong diagnostic performance (AUC > 0.80). The polymorphism of rs73221365 was associated with both CD and IS. Resveratrol hexanoic acid was a potential therapeutic candidate for CD-IS comorbidity. This study highlights the critical role of TLR-mediated inflammatory responses in CD-IS comorbidity.

"BackgroundAsthma, a prevalent chronic inflammatory disorder, is shaped by a multifaceted interplay between genetic susceptibilities and environmental exposures. Despite strides in deciphering its pathophysiological landscape, the intricate molecular underpinnings of asthma remain elusive. The focus has increasingly shifted toward the metabolic aberrations accompanying asthma, particularly within the domain of pyrimidine metabolism (PyM)—a critical pathway in nucleotide synthesis and degradation. While the therapeutic relevance of PyM has been recognized across various diseases, its specific contributions to asthma pathology are yet underexplored. This study employs sophisticated bioinformatics approaches to delineate and confirm the involvement of PyM genes (PyMGs) in asthma, aiming to bridge this significant gap in knowledge.MethodsEmploying cutting-edge bioinformatics techniques, this research aimed to elucidate the role of PyMGs in asthma. We conducted a detailed examination of 31 PyMGs to assess their differential expression. Through Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) and Gene Set Variation Analysis (GSVA), we explored the biological functions and pathways linked to these genes. We utilized Lasso regression and Support Vector Machine-Recursive Feature Elimination (SVM-RFE) to pinpoint critical hub genes and to ascertain the diagnostic accuracy of eight PyMGs in distinguishing asthma, complemented by an extensive correlation study with the clinical features of the disease. Validation of the gene expressions was performed using datasets GSE76262 and GSE147878.ResultsOur analyses revealed that eleven PyMGs—DHODH, UMPS, NME7, NME1, POLR2B, POLR3B, POLR1C, POLE, ENPP3, RRM2B, TK2—are significantly associated with asthma. These genes play crucial roles in essential biological processes such as RNA splicing, anatomical structure maintenance, and metabolic processes involving purine compounds.ConclusionsThis investigation identifies eleven PyMGs at the core of asthma's pathogenesis, establishing them as potential biomarkers for this disease. Our findings enhance the understanding of asthma’s molecular mechanisms and open new avenues for improving diagnostics, monitoring, and progression evaluation. By providing new insights into non-cancerous pathologies, our work introduces a novel perspective and sets the stage for further studies in this field.",Bioinformatics,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12931-024-02954-4,1
"IntroductionRhoptries proteins (ROPs) are crucial throughout different stages of theToxoplasma gondii(T. gondii) lifecycle, playing key roles in both the invasion of host cells and their subsequent survival. ROP34 is particularly noteworthy as it significantly influences host gene expression and aids in the transition from the tachyzoite to the bradyzoite form.Materials and methodsThis research utilized various bioinformatics tools to assess physico-chemical properties, allergenic and antigenic characteristics, sites for post-translational modifications (PTMs) and protein's secondary and three-dimensional structures of the ROP34 protein. Furthermore, the study identified potential B-cell, MHC-binding, and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) epitopes within the ROP34 sequence.ResultsThe ROP34 peptide comprised 553 amino acid residues, with a calculated average molecular weight (MW) of 61.60149 kDa, an aliphatic index of 73.98, and a GRAVY score of − 0.554. The antigenicity of the multi-epitope peptide was estimated to be 0.526563 and 0.6025 by the ANTIGENpro and VaxiJen servers, respectively, suggesting ROP34 as an immunogenic protein with no allergenic potential. Secondary structure analysis revealed a composition of 52.80% random coil, 36.17% alpha helix, and 11.03% extended strand. The Ramachandran plot for the refined model depicted that 97.46% of the residues were situated in the favored region.ConclusionThis in silico research serves as a foundation for designing effective immunization tactics to target toxoplasmosis.

"MicroRNAs are vital gene expression regulators, extensively studied worldwide. The large-scale characterization of miRNAomes is possible using next-generation sequencing (NGS). This technology offers great opportunities, but these cannot be fully exploited without proper and comprehensive bioinformatics analysis. This may be achieved by the use of reliable dedicated software; however, different programs may generate divergent results, leading to additional discrepancies. Thus, the aim of this study was to compare three bioinformatic algorithms dedicated to NGS-based microRNA profiling and validate them using an alternative method, namely RT-qPCR. The comparison analysis revealed differences in the number and sets of identified miRNAs. The qPCR confirmed the expression of the investigated microRNAs. The correlation analysis of NGS and qPCR measurements showed strong and significant coefficients for a subset of the tested miRNAs, including those detected by all three algorithms. Single miRNA variants (isomiRs) showed different levels of correlation with the qPCR data. The obtained results revealed the good performance of all tested programs, despite the observed differences. Moreover, they implied that some specific miRNAs may be differentially estimated using NGS technology and the qPCR method, regardless of the used bioinformatics software. These discrepancies may stem from many factors, including the composition of the isomiR profile, their abundance, length, and investigated species. In conclusion, in this study, we shed light on the bioinformatics aspects of miRNAome profiling, elucidating its complexity and pinpointing potential features influencing validation. Thus, qPCR validation results should be open to interpretation when not fully concordant with NGS results until further, additional analyses are conducted.",Bioinformatics,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10142-023-01276-w,1
"BackgroundNumerous studies have established a strong link between the overexpression of spindle apparatus coiled-coil protein 1 (SPDL1) and cancer progression. However, the role of SPDL1 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains unconfirmed.MethodsThe level of SPDL1 in HCC and its potential associations with prognosis and clinicopathological features were analyzed using TCGA and XENA databases. Bioinformatics and in vitro approaches were employed to investigate the biological functions, signaling pathways, and protein networks involving SPDL1. Additionally, correlation analyses were performed to explore the relationship between SPDL1 and the immune microenvironment.ResultsSPDL1 was overexpressed in HCC. Its overexpression correlated negatively with T stage, pathological stage, tumor status, age, body weight, differentiation, alpha-fetoprotein levels, vascular invasion, diagnosis, and poor prognosis in patients with HCC, positioning it as a risk factor for adverse outcomes. High-risk scores related to SPDL1 expression were significantly linked to poor prognosis in patients with HCC. Suppression of SPDL1 expression inhibited HCC cell proliferation, invasion, and migration. Furthermore, SPDL1 expression showed significant correlations with Th2 cells (r= 0.628), T helper cells (r= 0.296), Th17 cells (r= -0.422), neutrophils (r= -0.408), dendritic cells (r= -0.358), cytotoxic cells (r= -0.310), plasmacytoid dendritic cells (r= -0.275), and other immune cell populations in HCC.ConclusionOverexpression of SPDL1 is associated with poor prognosis and the immune microenvironment in HCC. Inhibition of SPDL1 expression can suppress tumor growth and metastasis, suggesting that SPDL1 may serve as a potential therapeutic target for HCC treatment.",Bioinformatics,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12672-025-03089-8,1
"Vitamin D deficiency is soaring among shift workers due to multiple issues, including poor UVB experience. The objective of this study was to identify precise mechanisms by which vitamin D deficiency might aggravate depressive symptoms among shift workers. Shift work is also associated with disrupting circadian rhythm, leading to depressive symptoms. Differential expressed genes (DEGs) in depression patients (GSE80655, GSE169459, GSE217811, GSE190518, GSE98793, GSE23848, GSE76826, GSE101521, and GSE54572) and in shift workers (GSE122541) with controls were examined in the GEO database. Genes associated with vitamin D deficiency were gathered from the GenCard database. Overlapping core targets were collected by uploading genes into the Bioinformatics and Evolutionary Genomics database. STRING database was used to screen the PPI (protein–protein interaction) network of cross-targets. Cytoscape was used to select core targets and to set up the pathway-gene network. GO (Gene Ontology) enrichment and KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) pathway investigations were executed by the database ShinyGO. A molecular docking examination was performed to explain the interaction between protein targets and calcitriol (active form of vitamin D), and binding affinity was confirmed by a 100-ns molecular dynamics simulation study. Our finding designated that the deficit of vitamin D might be involved in the pathology of depression among shift workers mainly through activation of the inflammatory response via upregulation of TNF, IL-6, and IL-1β (pro-inflammatory markers).",Bioinformatics,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00210-025-04709-4,1
"The aim of this study was to identify key genes and investigate the immunological mechanisms of atopic dermatitis (AD) at the molecular level via bioinformatics analysis. Gene expression profiles (GSE32924, GSE107361, GSE121212, and GSE230200) were obtained for screening common differentially expressed genes (co-DEGs) from the gene expression omnibus database.

"Although evidence suggests that an imbalance in Th1 and Th2 cell responses contributes to the pathogenesis of schizophrenia, the epigenetic mechanisms involved remain largely unknown. Here, we applied a combination of bioinformatics and experimental approaches to evaluate the alterations in Th1 and Th2-related genes in schizophrenia patients. Based on bioinformatics analysis, we selected Th1 (IFNG-AS1,TBX21,IFNG) and Th2-related genes (TH2LCRR,GATA3,IL-4), which are potentially implicated in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia. For experimental validation, we measured the expression levels of these transcripts in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from patients with acute-phase schizophrenia and controls. Bioinformatics findings revealed 2 lncRNAs, 9 miRNAs, 76 mRNAs, and 234 transcription factors (TFs) related to Th1 and Th2 cell lineages, which are involved in schizophrenia. Subsequent analysis of qPCR data showed a remarkable increase in the expression levels ofGATA3andTH2LCRRin the PBMCs of patients with schizophrenia compared to controls. Interestingly, bothTH2LCRRandGATA3exhibited greater diagnostic value in female subjects. However, our data showed no significant difference in the expression levels of Th1-related genes (IFNG-AS1,TBX21,IFNG) andIL-4between diagnostic groups. Furthermore, the expression levels ofIFNG-AS1andTH2LCRRwere positively correlated with cytokine expression in patient subjects. These findings further support the pivotal role of Th1/Th2 imbalance in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia. Our data highlight the necessity to evaluate the potential efficacy of immune-related genes to identify promising biomarkers for both the diagnosis and therapy of patients with schizophrenia.",Bioinformatics,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12035-025-05060-8,1
"The escalating prevalence of diabetic nephropathy (DN) has raised concerns about environmental pollutants, particularly polyethylene terephthalate microplastics (PET-MP), as potential contributors to metabolic diseases. However, the molecular mechanisms linking PET-MP exposure to DN remain unclear. This study integrates network toxicology and bioinformatics to explore PET-MP-induced nephrotoxicity in DN. PET-MP-related toxicity targets were identified using SwissTargetPrediction and SuperPred. DN-associated differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were derived from the GSE96804 dataset. Overlapping genes were analyzed via enrichment analyses (GO, KEGG), Gene Set Variation Analysis (GSVA), and protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks. Immune cell infiltration was assessed with CIBERSORT. Key genes were identified using machine learning models (LASSO, RF, SVM-RFE) and validated by a nomogram and molecular docking. Among 10,124 DN-related DEGs, 64 overlapped with PET-MP targets. These genes were enriched in pathways like VEGF signaling, PI3K activity, and oxidative stress responses. GSVA revealed significant dysregulation in 2,258 pathways, including inflammation, immune response, and ROS metabolism. Immune infiltration analysis showed reduced CD8 + T cells, monocytes, and neutrophils in DN, alongside increased Tregs and M2 macrophages. Machine learning models identified CASP3 and GRB2 as key feature genes, validated by robust cross-validation and two independent DN datasets. Molecular docking indicated favorable binding affinities of PET to CASP3 (Vina score: -5.3) and GRB2 (Vina score: -5.2), suggesting disruptions in apoptosis and signal transduction pathways. PET-MP may exacerbate DN by disrupting critical molecular and cellular pathways, compromising the regulation of apoptosis, immune responses, and cellular homeostasis. CASP3 and GRB2 emerge as central mediators, providing mechanistic insights into PET-MP-driven nephrotoxicity. This study underscores the role of environmental microplastics in metabolic disorders and highlights potential therapeutic targets for DN.",Bioinformatics,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1038/s41598-025-03285-0,1
"ObjectiveUlcerative colitis (UC), a chronic inflammatory bowel disease, continues to pose substantial challenges in both diagnosis and treatment. The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) plays a pivotal role in intestinal immune regulation; however, its core regulatory network in the progression of UC remains largely undefined. This study aims to identify core UC-related genes associated with AhR and to validate their expression in dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced murine models, thereby elucidating potential mechanisms underlying UC progression.MethodsUsing the GSE75214 and GSE87466 datasets from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database, immune cell infiltration was quantified via the CIBERSORT algorithm. Candidate genes were identified through differential expression analysis, weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) module selection, and construction of an AhR co-expression network. Gene Ontology (GO), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) were performed, followed by construction of a protein–protein interaction (PPI) network using STRING and application of two machine learning algorithms to identify AhR-associated hub genes. Finally, the expression of key genes was validated in DSS-induced UC mouse models using real-time quantitative real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR).ResultsA total of nine AHR-related shared genes were identified, which were significantly enriched in immune response, amino acid metabolism, and oxidative stress pathways. Through integration of the PPI network and machine learning approaches, three central hub genes (PPARG,IL1B, andIDO1) were identified. Immune infiltration analysis revealed pronounced immune dysregulation during the progression of UC, which may contribute to disease development. Animal experiments confirmed the expression of these three key genes in colonic tissues, and hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) staining revealed extensive infiltration of inflammatory cells, consistent with the bioinformatics findings.ConclusionPPARG,IL1B, andIDO1were identified as potential key genes closely associated with AHR, suggesting their possible involvement in modulating AhR signaling in UC, thereby offering a theoretical basis for disease diagnosis and therapeutic strategies.",Bioinformatics,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40246-025-00835-5,1
"Inhibin, β, which is also known as INHBA, encodes a protein that belongs to the Transforming Growth factor-β (TGF-β) superfamily, which plays a pivotal role in cancer. Gastrointestinal tract (GI tract) cancer refers to the cancers that develop in the colon, liver, esophagus, stomach, rectum, pancreas, and bile ducts of the digestive system. The role of INHBA in all GI tract cancers remains understudied. By utilizing GEPIA2, which uses transcriptomic data from TCGA, we examined the expression of INHBA across different GI tract cancers. The results revealed consistent upregulation of INHBA in all TCGA GI tract cancers, except for liver hepatocellular carcinoma, where it showed downregulation compared to normal tissues, along with GTEx normal samples. Significant differences in INHBA expression were noted in adenocarcinomas of the colon, pancreas, rectum, and stomach, while no such differences were observed in cholangiocarcinoma and liver cancer. Moreover, a comprehensive bioinformatics analysis has been done to demonstrate that the differences in expression levels are significantly related to pathological tumor stages and prognosis in different GI tract cancers. Mucinous adenocarcinoma, esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, and stomach adenocarcinoma show a higher frequency of INHBA alteration and are primarily linked to mutations and amplifications. DNA methylation, immune infiltration, functional enrichment analysis, the genes associated with INHBA, and survival analysis in all TCGA GI tract cancers have been extensively analyzed. In colon and stomach cancers, increased INHBA expression significantly correlates with poorer overall survival (OS). However, in colon and pancreatic adenocarcinoma, higher expression is significantly associated with worse disease-free survival (DFS). Additionally, INHBA expression exhibited a positive correlation with cancer-associated fibroblasts across all gastrointestinal (GI) tract cancers. The KEGG pathway analysis revealed that INHBA and its interacting proteins are involved in several pathways, including TGF-beta signaling, Signalling pathways regulating pluripotency of stem cells, colorectal cancer, pancreatic cancer, AGE-RAGE signaling, and so on as major pathways. These findings demonstrate that INHBA could serve as a potential biomarker therapeutic target for GI tract cancer.",Bioinformatics,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1038/s41598-024-72679-3,1
"Sepsis, characterized as a systemic inflammatory response triggered by pathogen invasion, represents a continuum that may progress from mild systemic infection to severe sepsis, potentially culminating in septic shock and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. A pivotal element in the pathogenesis and progression of sepsis involves the significant disruption of oncological metabolic networks, where cells within the pathological milieu exhibit metabolic functions that diverge from their healthy counterparts. Among these, purine metabolism plays a crucial role in nucleic acid synthesis. However, the contribution of Purine Metabolism Genes (PMGs) to the defense mechanisms against sepsis remains inadequately explored. Leveraging bioinformatics, this study aimed to identify and substantiate potential PMGs implicated in sepsis. The approach encompassed a differential expression analysis across a pool of 75 candidate PMGs. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) and Gene Set Variation Analysis (GSVA) were employed to assess the biological significance and pathways associated with these genes. Additionally, Lasso regression and Support Vector Machine-Recursive Feature Elimination (SVM-RFE) methodologies were implemented to identify key hub genes and evaluate the diagnostic potential of nine selected PMGs in sepsis identification. The study also examined the correlation between these hub PMGs and related genes, with validation conducted through expression level analysis using the GSE13904 and GSE65682 datasets. The study identified twelve PMGs correlated with sepsis, namely AK9, ENTPD3, NUDT16, GMPR2, PKM, RRM2B, POLR2J, POLE3, ADCY3, ADCY4, ADSSL1, and AMPD1. Functional analysis revealed their involvement in critical processes such as purine nucleotide and ribose phosphate metabolism. The diagnostic capability of these PMGs to effectively differentiate sepsis cases underscored their potential as biomarkers. This research elucidates twelve PMGs associated with sepsis, providing valuable insights into novel biomarkers for this condition and facilitating the monitoring of its progression.

"Lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC) is a subtype of non-small cell lung cancer. It has a grim prognosis for patients, primarily because the disease often remains asymptomatic in its early stages. As a result, it is frequently diagnosed at an advanced stage, limiting treatment options. This underscores the importance of studying potential biomarkers and developing personalized treatment strategies. In this study, we used an advanced bioinformatics approach, integrating two authoritative databases, NCBI's GEO and TCGA, to perform a large-scale cross-platform gene expression analysis. To deeply mine the gene expression data of a large number of lung squamous carcinoma samples, we used a screening strategy based on median absolute deviation to select genes that differed significantly in multiple datasets. The expression variations of these genes between normal and cancerous tissues provided us with valuable clues revealing key molecules that may be involved in the disease process. Through rigorous statistical tests, we identified 36 genes that were significantly associated with patient survival, and further constructed a model using Cox proportional risk model containing 11 key genes (MRPL40, GABPB1AS1, PTPN3, SNCA, PYGB, RAP1, VDR, PHPT1, KIAA0100, TBC1D30, CYP7B1) in a risk prediction model. The prediction model not only reflects the strong correlation between gene expression and LUSC prognosis, but also provides clinicians with an effective tool to predict patients' survival prospects. In the future, this model is expected to guide the development of individualized treatment plans, thereby improving the quality of life and overall prognosis of patients.",Bioinformatics,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12672-024-01717-3,1

"BackgroundOsteoarthritis (OA) is a prevalent degenerative joint disease that significantly contributes to global disability. Glycolysis, a fundamental process in cellular energy metabolism, is particularly vital for chondrocytes in OA. This study aims to explore the intrinsic relationship between glycolysis-related genes (GRGs) and OA.MethodsWe incorporated three publicly available datasets from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database, which included 64 OA samples and 34 normal controls. By utilizing differential expression analysis, weighted gene co-expression network analysis, protein-protein interaction networks, and machine learning methods, we identified three diagnostic biomarkers of OA patients. The expression levels of these biomarkers were validated by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and immunohistochemical (IHC). Additionally, a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) network was constructed to explore potential regulatory interactions.ResultsThrough bioinformatics and machine learning approaches, three glycolysis-related biomarkers—HMGB2, SLC7A5, and ADM—were identified. The diagnostic model based on these GRGs demonstrated high predictive accuracy, with an AUC of 0.92 in the training set and 0.85 in the validation set. Subsequently, qRT-PCR and IHC confirmed the differential expression of hub genes in human cartilage samples.

"The current mortality rates for breast cancer underscore the need for better prognostic tools; moreover, LIM and calponin homology domain 1 (LIMCH1), which is a protein with dual roles in cancer, is a promising candidate for investigation. This study employed an integrative approach combining bioinformatics analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) cohort and clinical immunohistochemistry (IHC) cohort data. We analysed LIMCH1 expression patterns, its associations with clinicopathological features and prognosis, and its impact on the tumour immune microenvironment (TIME). Functional annotations and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data were used to explore the underlying molecular mechanisms. Our analysis revealed that high LIMCH1 expression in breast cancer patients was significantly associated with unfavourable clinical outcomes and served as an independent prognostic indicator. The functional annotations revealed pathways related to carcinogenesis and metabolic reconfiguration, thus suggesting the role of LIMCH1 in tumour progression. Additionally, LIMCH1 expression was correlated with an immunosuppressive TIME characterized by increased numbers of M2 macrophages and reduced numbers of CD8 + T cells and NK cells.

"AbstractThe identification of risks associated with novel agricultural products of plant origin obtained via genome editing is an important aspect of genetic engineering. An extensive discussion is currently ongoing worldwide to clarify the similarities and differences between the “old” risks of “classic” GM plants and the “new” ones associated with genome editing, the lack of existing methods for identification and assessment of new risks. We propose here the concept of “safe by design” as applied to protection that is a new interesting tool that introduces good known standards of safety into plant bioengineering. This approach states that design options are identified to minimize or prevent risks and off-target of genome editing at the concept stage. The correlation between experimentally determined and in silico predicted off-target gRNA activity is a major challenge in the CRISPR system application. Today the most studies are focused on efficiency of gRNA design, while we pay attention specifically to the bioinformatics search and study of potential promoters, as the potential risk associates with a possible unplanned change in the transcriptional activity of promoters. We conveyed these strategies in the form of a risk assessment framework for regulation of new genetic technologies.",Bioinformatics,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1134/S0003683823060212,1
"Patients with schizophrenia (SCZ) exhibit a significantly higher prevalence of metabolic syndrome (MetS), suggesting a potential biological link between the two conditions. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this comorbidity remain unclear. This study aimed to identify shared molecular features between SCZ and MetS through integrated bioinformatics analyses. Peripheral blood transcriptomic datasets for SCZ (GSE38481) and MetS (GSE145412) were obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified using the limma package for SCZ and DESeq2 for MetS. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was performed to identify disease-related gene modules. Functional enrichment analysis of module genes was conducted using Metascape. Shared genes from disease-related modules were used to construct a protein–protein interaction (PPI) network via the STRING database, and hub genes were identified using the cytoHubba plugin in Cytoscape. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) was employed to explore the biological functions of the central hub gene in both disorders. Potential therapeutics were predicted using the Connectivity Map (CMap) and validated through molecular docking using CB-Dock2. Our analyses identified one SCZ-related and three MetS-related gene modules via WGCNA. A total of 48 intersecting genes were shared between the disease-related modules, which were primarily enriched in immune- and inflammation-related pathways. PPI network analysis revealed PGLYRP1 as a central hub gene, associated with immune dysregulation, metabolic abnormalities, and neurological dysfunction in both disorders. CMap analysis predicted several candidate compounds capable of reversing the PGLYRP1-centered comorbidity gene expression pattern, and subsequent molecular docking revealed that carbetocin demonstrated the highest binding affinity for PGLYRP1. In conclusion, immune and inflammatory processes are pivotal in the pathophysiology of SCZ–MetS comorbidity.

It is necessary to recognize and explore the immune-mitochondrial genes in septic shock.MethodsThe GSE57065 dataset was acquired from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database and filtered by limma and the weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA) to identify mitochondrial-related differentially expressed genes (MitoDEGs) in septic shock. The function of MitoDEGs was analyzed using the Gene Ontology (GO) analysis, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA), respectively. The Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) network composed of MitoDEGs was established using Cytoscape. Support Vector Machine Recursive Feature Elimination (SVM-RFE), Random Forest (RF), and Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) were used to identify diagnostic MitoDEGs, which were validated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis and Quantitative Real-time Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (qRT-PCR). Furthermore, the infiltration of immunocytes was analyzed using CIBERSORT, and the correlation between diagnostic MitoDEGs and immunocytes was explored using Spearman.ResultsA total of 44 MitoDEGs were filtered, and functional enrichment analysis showed they were associated with mitochondrial function, and the PPI network had 457 nodes and 547 edges. Four diagnostic genes, MitoDEGs, PGS1, C6orf136, THEM4, and EPHX2, were identified by three machine learning algorithms, and qRT-PCR results obtained similar expression levels as bioinformatics analysis. Furthermore, the diagnostic model constructed by the diagnostic genes had fine diagnostic efficacy. Immunocyte infiltration analysis showed that activated immunocytes were abundant and correlated with hub genes, with neutrophils accounting for the largest proportion in septic shock.ConclusionsIn this study, we recognized four immune-mitochondrial key genes (PGS1, C6orf136, THEM4, and EPHX2) in septic shock and designed a novel gene diagnosis model that provided a new and meaningful way for the diagnosis of septic shock.",Bioinformatics,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s41065-024-00350-y,1
"ObjectiveOsteoporosis poses a significant global health burden, characterized by reduced bone mass and an increased risk of fractures. Despite extensive research, the underlying molecular mechanisms driving osteoporosis remain incompletely understood. This study aimed to elucidate the roles of key regulatory genes and their causal mechanisms in osteoporosis through integrative bioinformatics analysis and Mendelian randomization (MR).MethodsGene expression data (GSE56815) was analysed to identify differentially expressed genes (GEGs) between high and low mineral density (BMD) groups. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) and GEGs analysis were performed. Functional enrichment analysis and protein–protein interaction (PPI) network analysis were conducted to characterize the biological roles of identified genes. Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis assessed causal relationships between gene expression levels and osteoporosis risk. 30 subjects (10 each of healthy/moderate/severe osteoporosis) and 20 rats (Sham/Model/sh-RPS6/Model + sh-RPS6 groups) were included in this study. Real-Time Quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-qPCR), Western blot and immunohistochemical analysis were used to detect RPS6 expression; bone histopathology was analyzed by Hematoxylin and Eosin (HE) staining; bone metabolism markers (N-MID) and inflammatory factors (IL-6, IL-1β) were determined using ELISA.ResultsDifferential gene expression analysis identified 2299 DEGs between high and low BMD samples. WGCNA revealed nine gene modules, with MEgrey exhibiting the strongest correlation with sample grouping. Integration of DEGs and WGCNA modules identified 572 candidate feature genes (CFGs) enriched in pathways relevant to bone metabolism. PPI network analysis identified 10 hub candidate feature genes (HCFGs), including HIST1H4J, POLR2F, POLR2H, HIST1H3A, TBP, RPS6, FAU, GTF2H4, HIST1H2AB, and RPL27. The results of the nomogram model suggest a high accuracy of the 10 HCFGs in predicting osteoporosis risk. MR analysis results in a causal relationship between RPS6 and osteoporosis risk. RPS6 expression was found to be disease severity-dependently elevated in osteoporosis patients (healthy group < moderate group < severe group, P < 0.01). In animal models, RPS6 knockdown significantly improved osteoporosis pathological features: restoration of bone trabecular structure and reduction of bone marrow cavity; it also reversed bone metabolic imbalance (N-MID up-regulation) and inflammatory response (TNF-α and IL-6 down-regulation).ConclusionThis integrative study combining bioinformatics, MR analysis, and experimental validation provides novel insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying osteoporosis. The findings highlight RPS6 as a key regulator promoting osteoporosis progression via modulation of bone remodeling and inflammatory responses, suggesting its potential as a promising therapeutic target and offering a foundation for future precision medicine strategies in osteoporosis management.",Bioinformatics,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s44411-025-00232-3,1
"This study aims to explore the coding sequence (CDS) of the putativeDUSgene inEimeria mediaand assess its potential biological functions during the parasite's lifecycle. Initially, oocysts were isolated from fecal samples of rabbits infected withE. media, from which DNA and RNA were extracted. These extractions were used as templates for PCR to successfully amplify the CDS of theDUSgene, confirming its presence within theE. mediagenome. Further analysis using quantitative PCR (qPCR) demonstrated significantly higher expression of theDUSgene in the precocious line (PL) compared to the wild type (WT). This differential expression highlights a potential functional role for theDUSgene in influencing the development and sporulation processes ofE. media, which may contribute to the precocious phenotype. Additionally, bioinformatics analysis provided insights into the evolutionary trends and structural characteristics of theDUSgene across different species, suggesting a broader biological significance. The elevated expression of theDUSgene in the PL suggests its critical involvement in the growth and reproductive processes of the parasite. This finding opens new avenues for research aimed at controllingE. mediainfection through targeted interventions in theDUSgene expression pathways.",Bioinformatics,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12917-024-04362-8,1
"Trastuzumab (Tra)-induced cardiotoxicity (TIC) is a serious side effect of cancer chemotherapy, which can seriously harm the health of cancer patients. However, there is currently a lack of effective and reliable biomarkers for the early diagnosis of TIC in clinical practice. Therefore, we screened the TIC candidate diagnostic gene solute carrier family 6 member 6 (SLC6A6) by combining multi-machine learning algorithm based on bioinformatics. In addition, cross-validation showed that SLC6A6 had a consistent expression trend in multi-data-sets. To further explore the diagnostic capability of SLC6A6 in TIC, we constructed a nomogram diagnostic model based on SLC6A6 expression level, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, calibration curve and decision curve analysis proved that SLC6A6 had good diagnostic capability. In order to further verify the TIC expression of SLC6A6 in the real world, we have constructed cell and animal models. Animal experiments showed that left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was significantly decreased (from 65.01 ± 3.30% and 351.32 ± 3.51%, p < 0.0001) after Tra injection, and severe cardiac function was impaired. Similarly, RT-QPCR demonstrated that SLC6A6 was significantly downregulated in Tra-treated cardiomyocytes in vitro and in vivo. Our study suggests that the differential expression of SLC6A6 in vitro and in vivo models is associated with TIC, which may be a candidate diagnostic gene for the early occurrence and development of TIC and a potential therapeutic target.",Bioinformatics,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1038/s41598-024-81335-9,1
"BackgroundGallstone disease (GSD) is a prevalent chronic hepatobiliary condition characterized by impaired metabolism of cholesterol, bilirubin, and bile acids. Gallstones are categorized as cholesterol, pigment (black and brown), or mixed stones. Genetic predisposition accounts for approximately 25% of cases, with multiple variants influencing GSD susceptibility.ObjectiveThis study investigates the association ofUGT1A1(rs6742078) andABCG8(rs11887534) polymorphisms with GSD through a meta-analysis, bioinformatics assessment of non-synonymous SNPs (nsSNPs).MethodsA systematic review of studies (UGT1A1andABCG8from January 2000 to January 2020) was conducted using databases such as PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and Web of Science. Meta-analyses pooled data from 6492 cases and 59,635 controls forUGT1A1, and 2628 cases and 1744 controls forABCG8. Comprehensive Meta-Analysis 3.0 software was used, applying fixed/random-effects models based on heterogeneity (I2> 50%,p< 0.1). Bioinformatics tools evaluated nsSNP deleteriousness and protein stability.ResultsTheUGT1A1 rs6742078variant was significantly associated with GSD (OR 1.119, 95% CI 1.017–1.232,p= 0.022). ForABCG8 rs11887534, the association was stronger (OR 2.573, 95% CI 1.988–3.329,p< 0.001). Bioinformatic analyses predicted bothUGT1A1rs72551341 andABCG8 rs11887534nsSNPs as deleterious, leading to reduced protein stability and likely phenotypic consequences.ConclusionThe meta-analysis confirms significant associations ofUGT1A1 rs6742078andABCG8 rs11887534polymorphisms with GSD, implicating glucuronidation and cholesterol transport pathways in disease etiology. Future studies should focus on functional analysis of these polymorphisms to enhance understanding of genetic predisposition to GSD and inform preventive strategies.",Bioinformatics,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s43042-025-00802-8,1
"Sepsis, characterized as a systemic inflammatory response triggered by the invasion of pathogens, represents a continuum that may escalate from mild systemic infection to severe sepsis, potentially resulting in septic shock and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. Advancements in lipidomics and metabolomics have unveiled the complex role of fatty acid metabolism (FAM) in both healthy and pathological states. Leveraging bioinformatics, this investigation aimed to identify and substantiate potential FAM-related genes (FAMGs) implicated in sepsis. The approach encompassed a differential expression analysis across a pool of 36 candidate FAMGs. GSEA and GSVA were employed to assess the biological significance and pathways associated with these genes. Furthermore, Lasso regression and SVM-RFE methodologies were implemented to determine key hub genes and assess the diagnostic prowess of nine selected FAMGs in sepsis identification. The study also investigated the correlation between these hub FAMGs. Validation was conducted through expression-level analysis using the GSE13904 and GSE65682 datasets. The study identified 13 sepsis-associated FAMGs, including ABCD2, ACSL3, ACSM1, ACSS1, ACSS2, ACOX1, ALDH9A1, ACACA, ACACB, FASN, OLAH, PPT1, and ELOVL4. As demonstrated by functional enrichment analysis results, these genes played key roles in several critical biological pathways, such as the Peroxisome, PPAR signaling pathway, and Insulin signaling pathway, all of which are intricately linked to metabolic regulation and inflammatory responses. The diagnostic potential of these FAMGs was further highlighted. In short, the expression patterns of these FAMGs c effectively distinguished sepsis cases from non-septic controls, which suggested that they may be promising biomarkers for early sepsis detection. This discovery not only enhanced our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underpinning sepsis but also paved the way for developing novel diagnostic tools and therapeutic strategies targeting metabolic dysregulation in septic patients. This research sheds light on 13 FAMGs associated with sepsis, providing valuable insights into novel biomarkers for this condition and facilitating the monitoring of its progression. These findings underscore the significance of purine metabolism in sepsis pathogenesis and open avenues for further investigation into therapeutic targets.",Bioinformatics,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1038/s41598-024-80550-8,1
"BackgroundOsteoarthritis (OA) is a common cause of disability among the elderly, profoundly affecting quality of life. This study aims to leverage bioinformatics and machine learning to develop an artificial neural network (ANN) model for diagnosing OA, providing new avenues for early diagnosis and treatment.MethodsFrom the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database, we first obtained OA synovial tissue microarray datasets. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) associated with OA were identified through utilization of the Limma package and weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA). Subsequently, protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis and machine learning were employed to identify the most relevant potential feature genes of OA, and ANN diagnostic model and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve were constructed to evaluate the diagnostic performance of the model. In addition, the expression levels of the feature genes were verified using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Finally, immune cell infiltration analysis was performed using CIBERSORT algorithm to explore the correlation between feature genes and immune cells.ResultsThe Limma package and WGCNA identified a total of 72 DEGs related to OA, of which 12 were up-regulated and 60 were down-regulated. Then, the PPI network analysis identified 21 hub genes, and three machine learning algorithms finally screened four feature genes (BTG2, CALML4, DUSP5, and GADD45B). The ANN diagnostic model was constructed based on these four feature genes. The AUC of the training set was 0.942, and the AUC of the validation set was 0.850. In addition, the qRT-PCR validation results demonstrated a significant downregulation of BTG2, DUSP5, and GADD45 mRNA expression levels in OA samples compared to normal samples, while CALML4 mRNA expression level exhibited an upregulation. Immune cell infiltration analysis revealed B cells memory, T cells gamma delta, B cells naive, Plasma cells, T cells CD4 memory resting, and NK cells The abnormal infiltration of activated cells may be related to the progression of OA.ConclusionsBTG2, CALML4, DUSP5, and GADD45B were identified as potential feature genes for OA, and an ANN diagnostic model with good diagnostic performance was developed, providing a new perspective for the early diagnosis and personalized treatment of OA.",Bioinformatics,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s13018-024-05340-4,1
"Myricetin is a natural flavonoid with anti-cancer and anti-inflammatory effects, but its mechanism for treating lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) remains unclearly. Therefore, bioinformatics, in silico and in vitro experiments were employed to elucidate this issue in this study. The core targets of myricetin against LUAD were screened by PharmaMapper (v2017), Assistant for Clinical Bioinformatics, STRING (v11.5) and Cytoscape (v3.8.1). Using Kaplan–Meier Plotter (v2022.04.20), UALCAN (v2021.12.13) and GEPIA (v2.0) databases, the correlation between core genes and the prognosis of LUAD patients were analyzed, and the expression levels of core genes were verified. In silico studies were used to analyze the binding energies and sites of myricetin with core genes. The effects of myricetin on H1975 cells were explored through thiazolyl blue (MTT), cell migration, colony formation and western blot assays. A total of 72 potential targets of myricetin against LUAD were identified through bioinformatics. Among the four core targets obtained by multiple networks and in silico assays, the up-regulated MMP9 (HR = 1.14 (1–1.29), logrank P = 0.046) and down-regulated PIK3R1 (HR = 0.58 (0.51–0.66), logrank P < 1E-16) were positively correlated with poor survival outcomes in LUAD patients. In vitro experiments demonstrated that myricetin inhibited the proliferation and migration of H1975 cells, promoting their apoptosis. Myricetin inhibits the proliferation of H1975 cells and induces cell apoptosis through its influence on the expression levels of MMP1, MMP3, MMP9, and PIK3R1 and regulating the multiple pathways these genes participate in. Both MMP9 and PIK3R1 are potential biomarkers for LUAD.",Bioinformatics,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00210-023-02859-x,1

"The study aimed to elucidate the functional characteristics ofOsASMT1gene under copper (Cu) or sodium chloride (NaCl) stress. Bioinformatics scrutiny unveiled thatOsASMT1is situated on chromosome 9. Its protein architecture, comprising dimerization and methyltransferase domains, showed significant similarities toOsASMT2andOsASMT3. High expression in roots and panicles, along with abiotic stress putativecis-regulatory elements in the promoter, indicated potential stress responsiveness. Real-time quantitative PCR confirmedOsASMT1induction under Cu and NaCl stress in rice. Surprisingly, yeast expressingOsASMT1did not exhibit enhanced resistance to abiotic stresses. The results of subcellular localization analysis indicated that OsASMT1 plays a role in the cytoplasm. WhileOsASMT1responded to Cu and NaCl stress in rice, its heterologous expression in yeast failed to confer abiotic stress resistance, highlighting the need for further investigation of its functional implications.",Bioinformatics,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10528-024-10774-w,1
"ObjectivesFrozen shoulder is a common shoulder disease that significantly affects the patient’s life and work. Ferroptosis is a new type of programmed cell death, which is involved in many diseases. However, there have been no studies reporting the relationship between frozen shoulders and ferroptosis. This study identified potential molecular markers of ferroptosis in frozen shoulders to provide more effective strategies for the treatment of frozen shoulders.MethodsGSE238053 was downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) dataset and intersected with ferroptosis genes to obtain differentially expressed genes (DEGs). The signaling pathways and biological functions of DEGs were performed by WebGestalt and Metascape. The interactions related to these DEGs and the key genes between frozen shoulders and ferroptosis was performed by STRING and Cytoscape. A frozen shoulders rat model was used to validate our predicted genes, Western Blot and qRT-PCR was used to assess the expression levels of our genes of interest.ResultsA total of 34 DEGs between GSE238053 and Ferroptosis Database were obtained, most of which were involved in the HIF-1 signaling pathway and inflammatory response. A protein–protein interaction network was obtained by Cytoscape and the key genes (IL-6, HMOX1 and TLR4) were screened by MCODE. Our results of Western Blot showed that the protein expression level of TLR4 and HMOX1 were elevated, and the protein level of IL-6 decreased in frozen shoulders rat model. The mRNA level after frozen shoulders showed that IL-6 was upregulated, whereas TLR4 and HMOX1were downregulated.ConclusionsThe results demonstrated that ferroptosis may affect the pathological process of frozen shoulders through these signaling pathways and genes.

"Osteoarthritis (OA) is a progressive cartilage degradation disease, concomitant with synovitis, osteophyte formation, and subchondral bone sclerosis. Over 37% of the elderly population is affected by OA, and the number of cases is increasing as the global population ages. Therefore, the objective of this study was to identify and analyze the hub genes of OA combining with comprehensive bioinformatics analysis tools to provide theoretical basis in further OA effective therapies. Two sample sets of GSE46750 contained 12 pairs OA synovial membrane and normal samples harvested from patients as well as GSE98918 including 12 OA and non-OA patients were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database (GEO) database. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified using Gene Expression Omnibus 2R (GEO2R), followed by functional enrichment analysis, protein–protein interaction networks construction. The hub genes were identified and evaluated. An OA rat model was constructed, hematoxylin and eosin staining, safranin O/fast green staining, cytokines concentrations of serum were used to verify the model. The hub genes expression level in the knee OA samples were verified using RT-qPCR. The top 20 significantly up-regulated and down-regulated DEGs were screened out from the two datasets, respectively.

"Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is a highly aggressive malignancy with complex molecular underpinnings. Hodgkin lymphoma (HL), another distinct cancer type, shares several biological characteristics with HNSCC, particularly regarding immune system involvement. However, the molecular crosstalk between HNSCC and HL remains largely unexplored. This study aims to elucidate shared molecular mechanisms, identify potential diagnostic biomarkers, and uncover therapeutic targets through an integrative approach combining bioinformatics and machine learning techniques. Publicly available RNA sequencing datasets were utilized to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in HNSCC, while weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was applied to uncover HL-associated gene modules. The intersection of HNSCC DEGs and HL-related modules was evaluated using protein–protein interaction (PPI) network analysis. Candidate hub genes were selected via machine learning algorithms, including LASSO regression, random forest, and support vector machine-recursive feature elimination (SVM-RFE). Prognostic and diagnostic values were assessed using survival analysis and ROC curves. Furthermore, scRNA-seq data were analyzed to assess gene expression in the tumor microenvironment, and drug sensitivity was evaluated to identify potential therapeutic agents. A total of 150 shared genes were identified at the intersection of HNSCC DEGs and HL-associated gene modules. PPI network analysis highlighted 16 candidate hub genes, among whichIL6,CXCL13, andPLAUwere prioritized through machine learning methods. Survival analysis revealed that high expression ofCXCL13andPLAU, and low expression of IL6, were significantly associated with poor prognosis in HNSCC patients. ROC curve analysis validated their diagnostic performance. Single-cell RNA-seq data confirmed the expression of these biomarkers in macrophages, epithelial cells, and fibroblasts within the tumor microenvironment. Drug sensitivity analysis identified Andrographolide, Rituximab, and Amiloride as potential therapeutic agents. This study identifiedIL6,CXCL13, andPLAUas critical biomarkers involved in immune regulation and tumor progression in both HNSCC and HL. These findings provide valuable insights into the shared molecular mechanisms and suggest novel therapeutic strategies for patients affected by these diseases.",Bioinformatics,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1038/s41598-025-99017-5,1
"This study aims to harness bioinformatics to identify prognostic immune-related genes in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), focusing particularly on LILRB3. It evaluates LILRB3’s expression in ccRCC, its association with patient prognosis, and its potential as a biomarker for predicting survival, thereby providing a preliminary basis for the diagnosis of ccRCC. Utilizing The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) datasets and an immune gene set, we sought immune-related genes with elevated expression in ccRCC. Seventy-two normal tissue samples and 531 ccRCC samples were analyzed, and differential genes were identified with a screening criterion of fold change (FC) > 2 andPvalue < 0.01. Survival analysis and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis were employed to discover genes of prognostic and diagnostic relevance to ccRCC. Pearson correlation analysis with a cutoff of |r|≥ 0.5, facilitated by cBioPortal, assessed genes co-expressed with LILRB3. The DAVID online tool conducted functional and pathway enrichment analyses for LILRB3-coexpressed genes. The TIMER and TCIA databases were utilized to explore LILRB3’s influence on immune infiltration in the tumor microenvironment and its relation to key immunological checkpoints. Screening the TCGA database revealed 3719 up-regulated differential genes in ccRCC, with 355 overlapping immune-related genes. Survival analysis of these 355 genes revealed 100 with significant survival impact. ROC curve analysis pinpointed the top 10 genes, including LILRB3, with the highest diagnostic efficiency. LILRB3 emerged as an independent risk factor from the Cox risk regression model. GO and KEGG analyses linked LILRB3 to various biological processes, including chemokine signaling pathways, immunological response, antigen processing and presentation, inflammatory response, T cell co-stimulation, and signal transduction. LILRB3 significantly affected ccRCC immune infiltration and correlated positively with several immunological checkpoints, such as PD-1, LAG3, IDO1, PD-L1, CTLA4, TIM3, TIGIT, and VISTA. LILRB3 shows higher expression levels in ccRCC than in normal tissues and correlates with poor patient prognosis. Its impactful role in the immune infiltration of the RCC microenvironment suggests that LILRB3 could serve as a novel target for ccRCC treatment and prognosis, underlining its diagnostic and prognostic significance.",Bioinformatics,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13353-024-00878-9,1
"Myocardial infarction and gut microbiota variations are interconnected conditions that can significantly impact a patient's quality of life. Myocardial infarction, colloquially known as heart attack is caused by decreased or complete cessation of blood flow to a portion of the myocardium. Alterations in the gut microbiota can lead to increased inflammation, a known risk factor for myocardial infarction. The gut microbiota also produces endotoxins, which can enter the bloodstream and contribute to the development of myocardial infarction. The interplay between myocardial infarction and gut microbiota variations should be explored, emphasizing their potential as a biomarkers and potential drug targets. The current study aimed to identify, investigate and analyze the interplay and biomarkers between myocardial infarction and the gut microbiota via transcriptomics data and integrated bioinformatics analysis. Common upregulated genes were identified via R language, gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG) for functional gene enrichment, and protein–protein interactions were constructed via the STRING Cytoscape plugin. Hub genes, essential modules, and drug interaction networks were identified. A total of 33 commonly upregulated genes were identified and, eight hub genes, including TLR4, TLR2, STAT3, CXCR2, CXCR4, IL1RN, CXCR1 and FCGR2A were identified. Additionally, 42 transcription factors and 23 miRNAs associated with the hub genes were identified. Furthermore, acetylcysteine, digoxin, celecoxib and osimertinib are potential drugs that interact with hub genes and are associated with the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. TLR4, TLR2, STAT3, CXCR2, CXCR4, IL1RN, CXCR1 and FCGR2A may play essential roles in myocardial infarction and gut microbiota.

"BackgroundThere is increasing evidence that inflammation plays a key role in the pathophysiology of periodontitis (PT) and Alzheimer’s disease (AD), but the roles of inflammation in linking PT and AD are not clear. Our aim is to analyze the potential molecular mechanisms between these two diseases using bioinformatics and systems biology approaches.MethodsTo elucidate the link between PT and AD, we selected shared genes (SGs) with gene-disease-association scores of ≥ 0.1 from the Disease Gene Network (DisGeNET) database, followed by extracting the hub genes. Based on these genes, we constructed gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis, pathway enrichment analysis, protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks, transcription factors (TFs)-gene networks, microRNAs (miRNAs)-gene regulatory networks, and gene-disease association analyses. Finally, the Drug Signatures database (DSigDB) was utilized to predict candidate molecular drugs related to hub genes.ResultsA total of 21 common SGs between PT and AD were obtained. Cell cytokine activity, inflammatory response, and extracellular membrane were the most important enriched items in GO analysis.

"LIM kinases (LIMK1 and LIMK2) serve as critical regulators of microtubule dynamics and mitotic progression, positioning them as promising targets for cancer therapy. However, most existing LIMK inhibitors lack specificity and cause toxic side effects due to the high sequence conservation between LIMK isoforms. Notably, no peptide-based inhibitors targeting the conserved ATP-binding pocket of LIMKs have been systematically investigated to date. To address this, an integrative structural bioinformatics approach, such as virtual screening of oligopeptide libraries, molecular dynamics simulations (MDS), and binding free energy analyses, was implemented to identify selective and less toxic peptide inhibitors. Among the top candidates, peptides with known anti-cancer, anti-inflammatory, and anti-angiogenic properties were prioritized. Interaction profiling revealed four and five tetrapeptides that closely mimicked interactions of LIMKi3 (BMS-5), a known Type-I inhibitor, with LIMK1 and LIMK2, respectively were shortlisted. Notably, MD and binding free energy analyses identified WRHF as a potent LIMK1 inhibitor with greater affinity than LIMKi3, while YYRW and WWHW exhibited superior stability and binding strength toward LIMK2. Overall, WRHF (LIMK1), YYRW, and WWHW (LIMK2) emerged as stable and high-affinity tetrapeptide inhibitors, demonstrating strong potential as selective, low-toxicity therapeutics for LIMK-targeted cancer treatment. However, in vitro and in vivo validation are essential to confirm their inhibitory efficacy and therapeutic potential, paving the way for the development of next-generation anti-cancer agents with reduced off-target effects.",Bioinformatics,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12032-025-03163-9,1
"BackgroundCOVID-19 is a disease that affects people globally. Beyond affecting the respiratory system, COVID-19 patients are at an elevated risk for both venous and arterial thrombosis. This heightened risk contributes to an increased probability of acute complications, including acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and acute ischemic stroke (AIS). Given the unclear relationship between COVID-19, AMI, and AIS, it is crucial to gain a deeper understanding of their associations and potential molecular mechanisms. This study aims to utilize bioinformatics to analyze gene expression data, identify potential therapeutic targets and biomarkers, and explore the role of immune cells in the disease.MethodsThis study employed three Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) datasets for analysis, which included data on COVID-19, AMI and AIS. We performed enrichment analysis on the co-DEGs for these three diseases to clarify gene pathways and functions, and also examined the relationship between co-DEGs and immune infiltration. Machine learning techniques and protein–protein interaction networks (PPI) were used to identify hub genes within the co-DEGs. Finally, we employed a dual validation strategy integrating independent GEO datasets and in vitro experiments with human blood samples to comprehensively assess the reliability of our experimental findings.ResultsWe identified 88 co-DEGs associated with COVID-19, AMI and AIS. Enrichment analysis results indicated that co-DEGs were significantly enriched in immune inflammatory responses related to leukocytes and neutrophils. Immune infiltration analysis revealed significant differences in immune cell populations between the disease group and the normal group. Finally, genes selected through machine learning methods included: CLEC4E, S100A12, and IL1R2. Based on the PPI network, the top ten most influential DEGs were identified as MMP9, TLR2, TLR4, ITGAM, S100A12, FCGR1A, CD163, FCER1G, FPR2, and CLEC4D. The integration of the protein–protein interaction (PPI) network with machine learning techniques facilitated the identification of S100A12 as a potential common biomarker for early diagnosis and a therapeutic target for all three diseases. Ultimately, validation of S100A12 showed that it was consistent with our experimental results, confirming its reliability as a biomarker. Moreover, it demonstrated good diagnostic performance for the three diseases.ConclusionWe employed bioinformatics methods and machine learning to investigate common diagnostic biomarkers and immune infiltration characteristics of COVID-19, AMI and AIS. Functional and pathway analyses indicated that the co-DEGs were primarily enriched in immune inflammatory responses related to leukocytes and neutrophils. Through two machine learning approaches and the PPI network, and subsequent validation and evaluation, we identified S100A12 as a potential common therapeutic target and biomarker related to immune response that may influence these three diseases.",Bioinformatics,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12883-025-04212-6,1
"AimsAccumulating evidences indicate that abnormalities in tubular lipid metabolism play a crucial role in the development of diabetic kidney disease (DKD). We aim to identify novel lipid metabolism-related genes associated with tubular injury in DKD by utilizing bioinformatics approaches.MethodsDifferentially expressed genes (DEGs) between control and DKD tubular tissue samples were screened from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database, and then were intersected with lipid metabolism-related genes. Hub genes were further determined by combined weighted gene correlation network analysis (WGCNA) and protein–protein interaction (PPI) network. We performed enrichment analysis, immune analysis, clustering analysis, and constructed networks between hub genes and miRNAs, transcription factors and small molecule drugs. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were employed to evaluate the diagnostic efficacy of hub genes. We validated the relationships between hub genes and DKD with external datasets and our own clinical samples.ResultsThere were 5 of 37 lipid metabolism-related DEGs identified as hub genes. Enrichment analysis demonstrated that lipid metabolism-related DEGs were enriched in pathways such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR) signaling and pyruvate metabolism. Hub genes had potential regulatory relationships with a variety of miRNAs, transcription factors and small molecule drugs, and had high diagnostic efficacy. Immune infiltration analysis revealed that 13 immune cells were altered in DKD, and hub genes exhibited significant correlations with a variety of immune cells. Through clustering analysis, DKD patients could be classified into 3 immune subtypes and 2 lipid metabolism subtypes, respectively. The tubular expression of hub genes in DKD was further verified by other external datasets, and immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining showed that except ACACB, the other 4 hub genes (LPL, AHR, ME1 and ALOX5) exhibited the same results as the bioinformatics analysis.ConclusionOur study identified several key lipid metabolism-related genes (LPL, AHR, ME1 and ALOX5) that might be involved in tubular injury in DKD, which provide new insights and perspectives for exploring the pathogenesis and potential therapeutic targets of DKD.",Bioinformatics,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00592-024-02278-1,1
"BackgroundMethylesterases (MESs) are a class of enzymes responsible for the demethylation of methylated compounds in plants, play a vital role in plant growth and development. However, studies on MES enzymes in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) are limited.ResultsThis study systematically identified MES genes in tomatoes for the first time and studied their physicochemical properties, evolutionary relationships, and expression patterns. SixteenSolanum lycopersicummethylesterase (SlMES) genes were identified through comprehensive bioinformatics analysis and were categorized into three subfamilies. Members of the same subfamily exhibited similar gene structures, structural domains, and conserved motifs. Chromosomal analysis revealed an uneven distribution ofSlMESsacross the five chromosomes, with evidence of gene duplication. Cis-acting element analyses suggested that theSlMESfamily may have important regulatory functions in tomato growth, development, and stress responses. Among them,Solyc02g065260was further examined for its role in tomato fruit ripening and stress responses. Its tissue-specific expression patterns, dynamic expression during fruit ripening, and responses to pathogens, low temperatures, and hormones, such as methyl jasmonate (MeJA), methyl salicylate (MeSA), abscisic acid (ABA), and ethylene (ET), were analyzed. The results provided further evidence towards understanding the roles of the SlMES family in the tomatoes.ConclusionsThe results established a theoretical foundation for future investigations into the functional characterization of MES genes during tomato growth and development.",Bioinformatics,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12870-025-06625-4,1
"In India, drug-resistant tuberculosis (DR-TB) is a major public health issue and a significant challenge to stop TB program. An estimated 27% of new TB cases and 44% of previously treated TB cases are resistant to at least one anti-TB drug. The conventional methods for DR-TB diagnosis are time-consuming and have limitations, leading to delays in treatment initiation and the spread of the disease. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) based approaches have emerged as a promising tool for diagnosing DR-TB, simultaneously offering rapid and accurate detection of resistance mutations in multiple genes. NGS-based approaches generate a large amount of data, which requires efficient and reliable bioinformatics pipelines for data analysis. TBProfiler and Mykrobe are the bioinformatics pipelines that have been created to analyze NGS data for the diagnosis of DR-TB. These pipelines use reference-based and machine-learning approaches to detect resistance mutations and predict drug susceptibility, enabling clinicians to make informed treatment decisions. Implementing NGS-based approaches and bioinformatics pipelines for DR-TB diagnosis can potentially improve patient outcomes by facilitating early detection of drug resistance and guiding personalized treatment regimens. However, the widespread adoption of these approaches in India faces several challenges, including high costs, limited infrastructure, and a lack of trained personnel. Addressing these challenges requires concerted effort to ensure equitable access to and effective implementation of these innovative technologies.",Bioinformatics,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12088-023-01134-0,1
"In this work, an efficient single-step green synthesis protocol of 2,3,4,4a-tetrahydroisoquinoline-5,7-dicarbonitriles was applied with the purpose of their biological activity studies. It was found that the cytotoxic activities of 2,3,4,4a-tetrahydroisoquinoline-5,7-dicarbonitriles in the SHSY-5Y cancer cell line were most active after 72 h of incubation. It was determined that 1,6-diamino-4a-methyl-3-oxo-2,8-diphenyl-2,3,4,4a-tetrahydroisoquinoline-5,7-dicarbonitrile showed higher anticancer activity on SHSY-5Y cancer cells compared to other molecules. The expression levels of Myc-N, Casp2, Tp53, RAD51, BRCA2, MDM2, BAX and NF-κB1 genes were analyzed by RT-PCR method by applying 2,3,4,4a-tetrahydroisoquinoline-5,7-dicarbonitriles to the SHSY-5Y neuroblastoma cancer cell line. It was observed that there were differences in expression levels between study groups and all differences were found to be statistically significant (p < 0.000). Bioinformatics analysis was performed using the STRING v 11 Protein interaction tool. When the molecules in the SHSY-5Y cell line were compared to the control group, an 80% increase in GSH levels was observed in 1,6-diamino-4a-methyl-3-oxo-2,8-diphenyl-2,3,4,4a-tetrahydroisoquinoline-5,7-dicarbonitrile and 1,6-diamino-8-(4-chlorophenyl)-4a-methyl-3-oxo-2-phenyl-2,3,4,4a-tetrahydroisoquinoline-5,7-dicarbonitrile groups. SOD enzyme activity increased significantly in the former group compared to the control and other groups. LDH activity was detected at a higher rate in this cell line compared to the control group.

"Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women. Currently, most treatments involve combinations of multiple therapies. However, existing drug therapies remain limited by side effects and drug resistance. (1E,4E)- 1,7-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)hepta- 1,4-dien- 3-one (DHDK) is a safer, potential targeted drug with strong anti-cancer activity, derived from mistletoe. However, few studies have explored its related treatment mechanisms. This study combined network pharmacology, bioinformatics, molecular docking, and experimental verification to elucidate the mechanism of action of DHDK in treating breast cancer. The SwissTargetPrediction database, Therapeutic Target Databases, and Comparative Toxicogenomics Databases were used for drug target identification. The Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database was employed for differential gene screening. The GeneCards, Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) database, and Therapeutic Target Databases (TTD) were utilized to identify DHDK’s breast cancer treatment targets. Nexus genes were identified using Cytoscape software after protein–protein interaction (PPI) analysis. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and Gene Ontology (GO) Resource were conducted to investigateunderlying mechanisms. Target were identified through molecular docking, and the selected signaling pathway was validatedby qPCR. Comprehensive analysis yielded possible targets and mechanisms: DHDK binds to JAK1, inhibiting the phosphorylation of tyrosine residues in downstream target proteins, recruiting and phosphorylating the transcription factor STAT, downregulating STAT1, and further inhibiting the downstream effector BCL2, ultimately inhibits the anti-apoptotic effect of tumor cells. Therefore, DHDK is a highly promising targeted anti-cancer drug.

"ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is considered a critical cardiac condition with a poor prognosis. Shortly after STEMI occurs, the increased number of circulating leukocytes including macrophages can lead to the accumulation of more cells in the myocardium, affecting the cardiac immune microenvironment. Identifying serum biomarkers associated with immune infiltration after STEMI is important for diagnosing and treating STEMI. In this work, we aimed to use integrated bioinformatics and machine learning methods to identify new biomarkers. First, candidate genes closely associated with M1 macrophage immune infiltration and STEMI were obtained using thelimmapackage, theCIBERSORTxpackage, weighted gene coexpression network analysis (WGCNA), and protein‒protein interaction (PPI) networks from the GSE59867 dataset, which comprises peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) samples. The STEMI patients were subsequently stratified into subtypes using theConsensusClusterPluspackage. Furthermore, using machine learning methods, we identified AKT3, GJC2, HMGCL and RBM17 as the genes with the greatest potential to be associated with STEMI subtypes and with M1 macrophage infiltration during the acute phase of STEMI. Finally, the expression profile and diagnostic value of the four feature genes were validated in the GSE59867 and GSE62646 datasets and in 24 patients using real-time PCR. This study revealed logically and comprehensively that AKT3, GJC2, HMGCL and RBM17, which are derived from PBMCs, could enhance the accuracy of STEMI diagnosis and might provide effective treatment options for STEMI patients.",Bioinformatics,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1038/s41598-025-89125-7,1
"BackgroundEarly-onset schizophrenia (EOS) occurs between the ages of 13 and 17 years, and neurobiological factors leading to cognitive deficits and psychotic symptoms with varying degrees of positive and negative symptoms. Numerous studies have demonstrated a broad link between immune dysregulation and the central nervous system in EOS, and its pathogenesis involves immune dysfunction, but the exact biological mechanisms have not been elucidated. This study employs immune infiltration analysis and bioinformatics to unveil the pathogenic mechanisms of EOS and identify potential diagnostic biomarkers, aiming for more precise clinical interventions.MethodsIn this study, we recruited 26 EOS patients and 27 healthy controls (HCs), and microarray data were collected. Crossover genes were identified using weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) and differential expression genes (DEGs) analysis. These genes were subjected to genome enrichment analysis (GSEA) and gene ontology (GO) analysis. Hub genes were identified through protein-protein interactions (PPIs) and the GeneMANIA database. The diagnostic potential of immune-associated hub genes was evaluated using ROC analysis. Immune infiltration in EOS was analyzed with CIBERSORT. Regulatory miRNAs for the hub genes were predicted using miRNet, and the correlation between mRNAs and miRNAs was analyzed and validated in clinical samples.ResultsBy WGCNA and DEGs analysis, 330 relevant genes were screened in EOS patients compared to HCs. Functional enrichment analysis using Metascape showed significant enrichment in immune system pathways. Subsequently, a PPI network was constructed to select the top 10 potential hub genes, and functional analysis was performed by GeneMANIA, resulting in the identification of four immune-related genes. In addition, significant differences were observed among the four immune cell types in the two groups of samples. ROC analysis showed clinical relevance of the immune-related hub genes, and the AUC of all genes was greater than 0.7. A miRNA-mRNA regulatory network was constructed from miRNA data, and three miRNAs were found to be significantly associated with the immune-related hub genes.ConclusionOur findings demonstrated that CCL3, IL1B, CXCL8, CXCL10 and miR-34a-5p may be biomarkers that play crucial roles in the underlying mechanisms of EOS immune-related pathways. These findings contribute to the understanding of EOS pathophysiology and may help identify new diagnostic and therapeutic targets.",Bioinformatics,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12888-025-06499-8,1

"AbstractEarly-career materials researchers often receive guidance from their individual advisors on best practices for conducting research, but the materials science community lacks an explicit model of the research process. As a result, the lived experience of an individual researcher can be quite different from their peers since they may be exposed to a different unique set of implicit research steps. In this article, we translate an existing research heuristic from other fields and make explicit the steps, methodologies, and strategies materials science engineering researchers utilize to advance our collective materials science knowledge. This newly proposed research cycle can improve the experience of both those early-career and established researchers by providing common expectations, increase the return-on-investment for research sponsors by encouraging robust planning, and increase the impact of our collective research work by encouraging knowledge development. This new research cycle for materials science and engineering clearly emphasizes that all researchers should review literature throughout a research cycle rather than just being conducted once during the initiation steps. In addition, researchers should consider incorporating engineering design principles when planning their experimental or computational research studies.Graphical abstractThis Research+ Cycle for materials science and engineering clearly emphasizes that 1) research questions are established with societal stakeholders in mind; 2) the literature is reviewed throughout a research cycle rather than just being conducted once during the initiation steps; 3) Planning an experiment requires incorporating engineering design principles and conducting preliminary analysis to refine the plan and replication of results.Impact statementOur field of materials science and engineering emerged in the 1950s, and while we have defined its focus as building knowledge about the interrelationships between material processing, structure/microstructure, properties, and performance in application, the collective community has not yet explicitly addressed what a general research cycle includes. Without an explicit, shared definition of research, it is difficult to train novice researchers. This impedes our community’s ability to establish new knowledge. We hope this article helps researchers by articulating the materials science and engineering research cycle and clarifies how this cycle is distinct from either the scientific method or the engineering design cycle. For novice researchers, this article should provide clarity on what research is and help them to more deeply engage in discovery. For experienced researchers, this article may help to initiate reflection on their own practices, thus gaining more awareness of the processes they use to construct new knowledge. Collectively, these changes could enable our community to gain deeper insights and perhaps make critical changes that result in more robust data or refined insights.",Materials Science,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1557/s43577-025-00931-w,2

"Recent work in science education has emphasized the importance of the conceptual, social, and epistemic dimensions in science learning. But what about the material dimension—the actual physical materials that students use? The way their characteristics and affordances limit or determine instruction has thus far not been as thoroughly explored. Despite the vast body of work that exists on science and engineering practices, there are relatively few examples of how physical science materials are linked to and can support engagement with such practices for sensemaking. In this paper, we propose a framework for analyzing the design of these physical materials and the activities associated with them that can serve as lenses for educators and researchers to consider when planning and reflecting on classroom instruction. To validate our framework, we apply it to analyze activities developed and implemented by teachers during a four-year research-practice partnership project conducted in a city in Brazil, and investigate potential connections between the design of physical materials and students’ epistemic agency.

"AbstractThe divertor is one of the most energy-loaded elements of the ITER experimental tokamak. During the ITER operation, the divertor experiences both stationary thermal loads and rapid thermal impacts owing to transient processes in the plasma. The potentially most harmful transients during normal operation are edge-localized modes (ELMs). To mitigate the thermal impacts caused by ELMs, a current approach involves reducing the energy content of individual ELMs by increasing their frequency (up to 30–60 Hz). Because of the high pulse repetition rate, ~108ELM events are expected during the foreseen lifetime of the divertor components. Such a large number of pulses can lead to thermocyclic fatigue of the divertor material, the formation of a microcracks network, and melting along the edges of cracks as a result of failure of heat conduction. At the Budker Institute of Nuclear Physics, an experimental stand to study the performance of plasma-facing materials under the influence of a large (≥107) number of ELM-like thermal impacts is being developed. To simulate the thermal impact on the material surface, it is planned to use a pulsed electron beam. In the present article, the prototype of an electron beam source for materials science research and the results of the beam characterization experiments are described. In experiments on electron beam generation, a beam current of 10 A at an accelerating voltage of 19 kV was achieved. The beam pulse duration of 1 ms at frequencies up to 10 Hz was demonstrated. Using imaging diagnostics based on luminescent ceramics, the beam current distribution was measured. The achieved beam parameters correspond to a specific power of 1.27 GW/m2, which meets the requirements for materials science applications in the interests of fusion-class facilities.",Materials Science,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1134/S1063778824130179,2

"Materials science is an interdisciplinary field that studies the properties, structures, and behaviors of different materials. A large amount of scientific literature contains rich knowledge in the field of materials science, but manually analyzing these papers to find material-related data is a daunting task. In information processing, named entity recognition (NER) plays a crucial role as it can automatically extract entities in the field of materials science, which have significant value in tasks such as building knowledge graphs. The typically used sequence labeling methods for traditional named entity recognition in material science (MatNER) tasks often fail to fully utilize the semantic information in the dataset and cannot effectively extract nested entities. Herein, we proposed to convert the sequence labeling task into a machine reading comprehension (MRC) task. MRC method effectively can solve the challenge of extracting multiple overlapping entities by transforming it into the form of answering multiple independent questions. Moreover, the MRC framework allows for a more comprehensive understanding of the contextual information and semantic relationships within materials science literature, by integrating prior knowledge from queries. State-of-the-art (SOTA) performance was achieved on the Matscholar, BC4CHEMD, NLMChem, SOFC, and SOFC-Slot datasets, with F1-scores of 89.64%, 94.30%, 85.89%, 85.95%, and 71.73%, respectively in MRC approach.

"Abstract—An analysis of current trends and opportunities for the application of artificial intelligence (AI) in materials science and concrete technology, including 3D printing in construction, is presented. The key role of AI in predicting material properties, developing new materials, and quality control is highlighted. By analyzing large volumes of data collected from numerous studies, AI can suggest optimal parameters to achieve desired material properties, thereby reducing costs and increasing production efficiency. Existing rheological models, such as the Bingham–Shvedov model or the Herschel–Bulkley model, describe material behavior based on specific equations and parameters. These models can be useful in predicting concrete properties, especially when data on its component composition is available.

The goal of this work is, without trying to cover this immensity, to attempt, using a relatively small number of striking examples, to trace how issues of scientific creativity are reflected in DLs; to discuss and dispel stereotypical ideas about scientists as unsociable, pedantic formalists or eccentric, absent-minded persons; and to show how the peculiarities of scientists’ thought processes combined with high intelligence can cause misunderstanding in everyday life. At the same time, these qualities combined with originality of thinking, sometimes becoming a paradox, are manifested in non-standard approaches to problems, non-trivial solutions, and an ironic attitude towards the surrounding reality. As a result, along with serious results, unexpected associations and analogies, jokes, witticisms, and anecdotes are born. The paper provides examples of the creativity of scientists in the professional field as well as works in genres such as science fiction, utopia, humor, and art song. Materials from more than 20 DLs were used.",Materials Science,https://link.springer.com/article/10.3103/S0005105525700141,2
"Ensemble machine learning (ML) methods have become pivotal in advancing materials science and physics, especially between 2023–2025, where predictive accuracy, uncertainty quantification, and model robustness are paramount. This review presents a comprehensive survey of modern ensemble approaches, focusing on bagging, boosting, stacking, and mixture-of-experts (MoE), and their applications across materials discovery, property prediction, and physical simulations. For instance, ensemble graph neural networks (GNNs) improved formation energy prediction with a mean absolute error (MAE) reduction from 0.072 eV/atom (single CGCNN) to 0.054 eV/atom (ensemble CGCNN), while stacked PINNs (Physics-Informed Neural Networks) reduced L\(^2\)errors by over 40% in inverse heat conduction tasks. Highlight trends such as: (i) ensemble GNNs combining CGCNN, GAT, and GraphSAGE for robust multi-property regression, (ii) PINN ensembles leveraging subdomain decomposition and model averaging for solving partial differential equations (PDEs), and (iii) hybrid frameworks integrating language models with structural GNNs for multi-modal property inference. Metrics like expected calibration error (ECE <5%), negative log-likelihood (NLL), and prediction interval coverage are emphasized for uncertainty assessment. Benchmark datasets including Matbench, QM9, and OC20 demonstrate how ensembles outperform single learners across diverse domains. This review presents a roadmap for integrating ensemble methods with physics priors, aiding in the development of interpretable, transferable, and accurate scientific models.",Materials Science,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11831-025-10325-5,2

"Metallurgy is one of the oldest sciences, with origins tracking back more than 6,500 years, and the backbone of civilisation enabling progress from simple tools to space exploration. In the mid-twentieth century, scientists started applying principles from metallurgy to all classes of materials, giving rise to the modern field of materials science and engineering, an inherently interdisciplinary discipline integrating physics, chemistry, and engineering. The processing-structure–property-performance relationships, often represented as the materials science tetrahedron, provided a unifying framework that has driven innovations across diverse fields, from construction and transportation to renewable energy and medical technologies.Journal of Materials Science (JMSC),established in 1966 by Robert W. Cahn, a distinguished physical metallurgist, renowned for his work on thermodynamics and the kinetics of phase transformations in solids, quickly became a leading platform for the growing materials science community. Similar to metallurgy itself, JMSC continues to thrive while broadening its scope to cover all classes of materials. This new sister journal,Journal of Materials Science: Metallurgy, brings the focus back to metallurgy, aiming to capture the new era of discoveries in one of humanity’s most foundational and continually evolving sciences.",Materials Science,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s44492-025-00001-x,2
"Obtaining a fine approximation of a black-box function is important for understanding and evaluating innovative materials. Active learning aims to improve the approximation of black-box functions with fewer training data. In this study, we investigate whether active learning based on uncertainty sampling enables the efficient approximation of black-box functions in regression tasks using various material databases. In cases where the inputs are provided uniformly and defined in a relatively low-dimensional space, the liquidus surfaces of the ternary systems are the focus. The results show that uncertainty-based active learning can produce a better black-box function with higher prediction accuracy than that by random sampling. Furthermore, in cases in which the inputs are distributed discretely and unbalanced in a high-dimensional feature space, datasets extracted from materials databases for inorganic materials, small molecules, and polymers are addressed, and uncertainty-based active learning is occasionally inefficient. Based on the dependency on the material descriptors, active learning tends to produce a better black-box functions than random sampling when the dimensions of the descriptor are small. The results indicate that active learning is occasionally inefficient in obtaining a better black-box function in materials science.",Materials Science,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1038/s41598-024-76800-4,2
"BackgroundThe Dental Materials Science (DMS) course within Malaysian undergraduate dental education has traditionally been taught in isolation, with a relatively stagnant delivery mode. Recent shifts in national dental competency standards have necessitated substantial reform in the DMS curriculum. This study aims to outline the journey of a local dental institute in developing and implementing a competency-based DMS curriculum.MethodsA faculty curriculum task force was established to oversee the curriculum reform process. The reform was guided by a “bottom-up” approach using the five-step curriculum reform model: (1). Curriculum mapping, (2). Comprehensive needs assessment, (3). Clear learning objectives and outcomes, (4). Curriculum development and implementation, and (5). Continuous evaluation and improvement.ResultsStep 1 revealed the need to reduce content repetition and improve alignment with the new competency standards. Step 2 identified the need to include advanced materials, integrate theoretical and clinical aspects, and enhance teaching methods. The new curriculum included 25 relevant topics. Step 3 established three course learning outcomes, while Step 4 integrated DMS content horizontally and vertically across the curriculum, introduced innovative teaching methods, and diversified assessment methods. Step 5 ensured ongoing curriculum monitoring, with both short-term and long-term evaluations planned.ConclusionThe curriculum reform process represents a significant advancement in dental materials science while addressing challenges and aligning the curriculum with national standards. Ongoing evaluation, adaptability, interdisciplinary collaboration, and international engagement are essential for further improvements. This journey serves as a valuable reference for educators seeking to update their DMS curricula.",Materials Science,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12909-024-06223-2,2
"A Laue microdiffraction beamline (BL03HB) was constructed at the Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility (SSRF). This beamline features two consecutive focusing points in two different sectors within its end station, the first dedicated to protein crystallography and the other tailored to materials science applications. Based on a superbend dipole magnet with a magnetic field of 2.29 T, a two-stage focusing design was implemented with two sets of Kirkpatrick-Baez mirrors to achieve a micro white beam as small as 4.2\({\upmu }\)m\(\times\)4.3\({\upmu }\)m at the first sector and 0.9\({\upmu }\)m\(\times\)1.3\({\upmu }\)m at the second sector in the standard beamline operation mode at SSRF. The X-ray microbeam in the two sectors can be easily switched between monochromatic and white beams by moving a four-bounce monochromator in or out of the light path, respectively. In the protein crystallography sector, white-beam Laue microdiffraction was demonstrated to successfully determine the structure of protein crystals from only a few images of diffraction data collected by a Pilatus 2 M area detector. In the materials science sector, the white-beam Laue diffraction was collected in a reflection geometry using another Pilatus 2 M area detector, which could map the microstructural distribution on the sample surface by scanning the samples. In general, the BL03HB beamline promotes the application of Laue microdiffraction in both protein crystallography and materials science.

"A young Steve Jobs once called computers ‘bicycles for the mind’—he was referring to the dramatic decrease in the energetic cost of transportation that could be obtained with the bicycle, which breaks all scaling laws for how efficiently an animal can achieve motion. The creativity of new approaches to old materials science problems facilitated by the dramatic uptake of machine learning (ML) is a testament to this notion. The uptake of ML in our subject has been facilitated by exceptional efforts to provide open datasets, e.g. Novel Materials Discovery (NOMAD)1, Materials Project2, Joint Automated Repository for Various Integrated Simulations (JARVIS)3, Automatic FLOW for Materials Discovery (AFLOW)4, Open Quantum Materials Database (OQMD)5and many others, as well as the extremely high quality of openly available software packages such as scikit-learn6, PyTorch7, (Just After eXecution) JAX8, Quantum Espresso9, and Large-scale Atomic/Molecular Massively Parallel Simulator (LAMMPS)10.

"Finite element analysis (FEA) is widely used to analyze the physical and mechanical properties of materials. However, its mathematical precision makes it challenging to handle uncertainties and noise within the data, making it difficult to deduce system inputs from the outputs, which limits its applicability in inverse analysis. Moreover, FEA simulations for complex material problems often require substantial time and computational resources. Machine learning (ML), by learning input–output mappings from training data, can effectively address inverse problems with non-unique solutions. Additionally, it can reduce computational time and costs. Therefore, the integration of ML with FEA can complement their respective strengths and better address real-world challenges in materials engineering. This review systematically explores the applications of ML combined with FEA in areas such as parameter inversion, computational process acceleration and optimization, material property prediction, and material design and optimization. Finally, future directions for the development of the integration of ML and FEA are discussed.Graphical abstract",Materials Science,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10853-025-10913-7,2

"BackgroundDental materials science is an important subject, but research on curriculum mapping in preclinical dental materials science courses is still scarce. The present study aimed to conduct a curriculum mapping in analysing elements and suggesting recommendations for an institutional dental materials science course.MethodsCurriculum mapping was conducted for the Year 2 undergraduate dental materials science course (Bachelor of Dental Surgery programme) in a Malaysian dental school. Based on Harden’s framework, the following steps were used to map the curriculum of the institutional dental materials science course: (1) scoping the task; (2) deciding the mapping format; (3) populating the windows, and (4) establishing the links. Two analysts reviewed the curriculum independently. Their respective analyses were compared, and discrepancies were discussed until reaching a consensus. A SWOT analysis was also conducted to evaluate the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats associated with the curriculum.ResultsCourse learning outcomes, course contents, levels of cognitive and psychomotor competencies, learning opportunities, learning resources, learning locations, assessments, timetable, staff, curriculum management and students’ information were successfully scoped from the institutional dental materials science course. The present curriculum’s strengths included comprehensiveness, alignment with standards, adequate learning opportunities, well-defined assessment methods, and sufficient learning resources. However, the identified weaknesses were repetition in curriculum content, limited emphasis on the psychomotor domain, dependency on a single academic staff, and limited integration of technology. The SWOT analysis highlighted the opportunities for curriculum improvement, such as revising repetitive content, emphasising the psychomotor domain, and incorporating advanced teaching strategies and technology.ConclusionsThe present dental materials science curriculum demonstrated several strengths with some areas for improvement. The findings suggested the need to revise and optimise the course content to address gaps and enhance student learning outcomes. Ongoing monitoring and evaluation are necessary to ensure the curriculum remains aligned with emerging trends and advancements in dental materials science.",Materials Science,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12909-023-04717-z,2
"AbstractIn order to extend the operational life of the BN-600 reactor, it is necessary to validate operability of the nonreplaceable reactor elements—including the neutron reflector—that operate under the conditions with high damaging doses and high temperatures. This can be done through irradiating metal of a simulating package inside a materials science assembly (MSA) inserted in the BN-600. The paper describes the main characteristics of the assembly, including the design features and irradiation parameters. Described are the basic principles of selecting the location for the materials science assembly in the reactor and for specimens inside the assembly in order to ensure the required irradiation conditions for the metal specimens. With comparison of the locations of the materials science assembly in the reactor core and in the radial blanket, the effect that the location of the materials science assembly has on the characteristics of the reactor standard fuel assemblies and on the neutron flux field is discussed. To calculate the irradiation parameters and the effect that the location has on the materials science assembly, the same methods and programs are used as for the reactor core design work. The effect of the materials science assembly on the reactor core neutronic characteristics has been shown to be minimal when the assembly is installed in the radial blanket.",Materials Science,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1134/S106377882310023X,2
"Although the convergence of high-performance computing, automation, and machine learning has significantly altered the materials design timeline, transformative advances in functional materials and acceleration of their design will require addressing the deficiencies that currently exist in materials informatics, particularly a lack of standardized experimental data management. The challenges associated with experimental data management are especially true for combinatorial materials science, where advancements in automation of experimental workflows have produced datasets that are often too large and too complex for human reasoning. The data management challenge is further compounded by the multimodal and multi-institutional nature of these datasets, as they tend to be distributed across multiple institutions and can vary substantially in format, size, and content. Furthermore, modern materials engineering requires the tuning of not only composition but also of phase and microstructure to elucidate processing–structure–property–performance relationships. To adequately map a materials design space from such datasets, an ideal materials data infrastructure would contain data and metadata describing (i) synthesis and processing conditions, (ii) characterization results, and (iii) property and performance measurements. Here, we present a case study for the low-barrier development of such a dashboard that enables standardized organization, analysis, and visualization of a large data lake consisting of combinatorial datasets of synthesis and processing conditions, X-ray diffraction patterns, and materials property measurements generated at several different institutions. While this dashboard was developed specifically for data-driven thermoelectric materials discovery, we envision the adaptation of this prototype to other materials applications, and, more ambitiously, future integration into an all-encompassing materials data management infrastructure.",Materials Science,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40192-024-00345-7,2

"A workshop on high-temperature materials for hypersonic vehicles was held at the 3rd International Conference on High-Speed Vehicle Science and Technology in Busan, South Korea, April 14–19, 2024. The objective of the workshop was to generate recommendations for technology development that would lead to further use of high-temperature materials on hypersonic vehicles. While a variety of high-temperature material systems were referenced and discussed, ceramic matrix composites (CMCs) were highlighted as being of particular importance, and maturing CMCs was the primary focus of the workshop. Utilizing CMC hot structures for re-entry and hypersonic vehicles can reduce weight and increase performance. CMC hot structures nominally provide a 25% weight saving over insulated cold structures. However, there are still improvements to be made in the manufacturing and characterization of CMCs prior to them becoming state-of-the-art for hot structures on hypersonic vehicles. The successful use of hot structures can be expanded by: (a) following four gates of CMC maturation, (b) establishing updated material-testing standards and (c) adopting a damage-tolerant design approach.",Materials Science,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12567-025-00609-8,2

However, it is unclear what and why teachers customize curriculum to support emergent multilingual learners’ use of linguistic and multimodal representations for scientific sensemaking. In this study, we investigated how teacher beliefs about language and their schools’ language policy contexts related to the types of customizations for emergent multilingual learners they reported making to open educational resource science curricular materials. We employed a cross-sectional survey design with follow-up interviews to gain a more nuanced perspective from a subset of teachers. Our analysis included both descriptive analyses of Likert-style teacher beliefs data and qualitative coding of teachers’ survey and interview data. Findings suggested that teachers who worked in schools with restrictive language policies did not tend to welcome emergent multilingual learners to use their home languages in science, while teachers who worked in schools with more expansive language policies tended to welcome students’ home languages for science learning. Additionally, teachers’ curricular customizations tended to align with their beliefs about language in science—whether customizing to welcome multimodal communication or customizing to focus on students’ acquisition of English.

As a model system, we use image sequences of atomic force microscopy showing the crystallization of an amorphous fluoroelastomer film. To identify crystalline particles in an amorphous matrix and track the temporal evolution of the particle dispersion, we have developed quantitative methods of 2D analysis. 700 image sequences were analyzed using a neural network architecture, achieving 0.97 pixel-wise classification accuracy as a measure of the correctly classified pixels. The growth kinetics of isolated and impinged particles were tracked throughout time using these image sequences.

"Wood–plastic composites (WPCs) have gained popularity in outdoor applications due to their unique properties compared to conventional materials. However, these composites suffer from low energy storage capacity. To address this limitation and the growing need for energy-efficient and sustainable building materials, researchers have explored the integration of phase change materials (PCMs) into WPCs. Incorporating PCMs into WPCs enhances energy storage, regulates indoor temperatures, and reduces energy consumption, making them more effective for sustainable construction. This short review explores the potential enhancement of thermal properties in wood–plastic composites (WPCs) by incorporating phase-change materials (PCMs). It reviews published research data that assesses the compatibility of various types of PCMs with WPCs and evaluates their impact on the composite properties. The bibliography results indicate that incorporating phase change material (PCM) into WPCs can significantly improve thermal regulation and energy efficiency, particularly with high PCM loadings. Nevertheless, the addition of PCMs to WPCs can present limitations such as compatibility issues, lower thermal conductivity than the polymer matrix and wood fibers, potential negative impact on mechanical properties, migration and leaching of PCMs over time, increased manufacturing costs, and technical challenges in achieving uniform dispersion. Careful selection of appropriate PCMs and their loading levels in WPCs is necessary to achieve optimum thermal performance. However, addressing these limitations offers opportunities to enhance the use of WPCs incorporated in PCMs as new, durable, and sustainable materials in architectural and construction applications.",Materials Science,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s41207-024-00641-w,2
"In alignment with the Materials Genome Initiative and as the product of a workshop sponsored by the US National Science Foundation, we define a vision for materials laboratories of the future in alloys, amorphous materials, and composite materials; chart a roadmap for realizing this vision; identify technical bottlenecks and barriers to access; and propose pathways to equitable and democratic access to integrated toolsets in a manner that addresses urgent societal needs, accelerates technological innovation, and enhances manufacturing competitiveness. Spanning three important materials classes, this article summarizes the areas of alignment and unifying themes, distinctive needs of different materials research communities, key science drivers that cannot be accomplished within the capabilities of current materials laboratories, and open questions that need further community input. Here, we provide a broader context for the workshop, synopsize the salient findings, outline a shared vision for democratizing access and accelerating materials discovery, highlight some case studies across the three different materials classes, and identify significant issues that need further discussion.Graphical abstract",Materials Science,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1557/s43577-024-00846-y,2
"One of the dominant tendencies in the development of modern science is the integration of natural science and humanitarian knowledge. Proceeding from the fact that the historical science is based mainly on material artifacts, the importance of studying the material of these artifacts is extremely high. The characteristics of artifact materials, obtained by combining various methods of historical study, significantly supplement and expand the source study potential of cultural heritage sites. A similar set of natural science methods is used to investigate art product materials, which, being combined with art history analysis, allows one to solve a number of scientific restoration problems.",Materials Science,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1134/S1063774522050133,2

"Science is integral to society because it can inform individual, government, corporate, and civil society decision-making on issues such as public health, new technologies or climate change. Yet, public distrust and populist sentiment challenge the relationship between science and society. To help researchers analyse the science-society nexus across different geographical and cultural contexts, we undertook a cross-sectional population survey resulting in a dataset of 71,922 participants in 68 countries. The data were collected between November 2022 and August 2023 as part of the global Many Labs study “Trust in Science and Science-Related Populism” (TISP). The questionnaire contained comprehensive measures for individuals’ trust in scientists, science-related populist attitudes, perceptions of the role of science in society, science media use and communication behaviour, attitudes to climate change and support for environmental policies, personality traits, political and religious views and demographic characteristics. Here, we describe the dataset, survey materials and psychometric properties of key variables. We encourage researchers to use this unique dataset for global comparative analyses on public perceptions of science and its role in society and policy-making.",Materials Science,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1038/s41597-024-04100-7,2

"The scientific literature on Al-Si alloy materials is a rich source of factual information about various classes of entities (e.g., alloys, properties, and compositions) as well as various relationships between these entities. Automatically extracting this information using natural language processing (NLP) techniques to generate a knowledge graph for Al-Si alloy materials is a challenging task. In this paper, we propose ASaRE-Net (Al-Si alloy Relationship Extraction Network) to extract entities and relationships from Chinese scientific literature on Al-Si alloy materials, thus forming a triple (Entity 1, Relation, Entity 2) as the basic unit for constructing a knowledge graph. Due to the complexity of overlapping triples and many triples in a text sentence, this paper designs a triple-aware module based on knowledge representation learning, which is used to mine the correlation between entities and relations, and uses a simple and efficient labeling strategy to decode, so as to alleviate the problem of cascading errors. This paper defines 11 types of entity and 13 types of relationship for Al-Si alloy materials, and constructs ASaIED (Al-Si alloy Information Extraction Dataset). Experimental results show that compared to the strongest baseline, the proposed model improves the F1 score by 2.34% on the ASaIED dataset, and demonstrates better performance in scenarios involving SEO overlapping types and many triples. The proposed model can continuously provide credible data for constructing knowledge graphs in the field of Al-Si alloy materials.",Materials Science,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10853-024-10074-z,2
"Sixty years ago, Derek de Solla Price’s influentialLittle Science, Big Sciencefirst documented that from 1900 scientific publications doubled every 10–15 years and then predicted that limited resources would end rapid progress leading to an imminent “scientific doomsday”—a strikingly false prediction given that contemporary global mega-science annually yields 3.5 million mainline STEMM journal research papers. Nevertheless, the idea of a coming crisis persists—supposedly current expansion is stagnating quality. Argued instead is that what was missed, then and now, is a worldwide deepening ofscientization—the embedding of science as a core social institution, marked by expanded research capacity, diversification into new domains, and increasing specialization. Employing sociological insights about historical institutional development, Price’s empirics are extended to explain why STEMM productivity never plateaued. Fueled by a worldwide education revolution, universities enact three institutionalizing roles:institutional entrepreneurs; main corporate units of research; and a fiduciary of thegeneralized symbolic mediumof papers. Illustrated by analyses from a recent bibliometric study of 3.3 million papers from 1900 to 2020, it is further suggested that instead of decline, through university-driven scientization the scale and capacity of science as a mature institution reshape the dynamics of discovery supporting sustained growth and quality.",Materials Science,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11024-025-09602-1,2
"This study is an analysis of the international debate on open science that took place during the pandemic. It addresses the question, how did the COVID-19 pandemic impact the debate on open science? The study takes the form of a qualitative analysis of a large corpus of key articles, editorials, blogs and thought pieces about the impact of COVID on open science, published during the pandemic in English, German, Portuguese, and Spanish. The findings show that many authors believed that it was clear that the experience of the pandemic had illustrated or strengthened the case for open science, with language such as a “stress test”, “catalyst”, “revolution” or “tipping point” frequently used. It was commonly believed that open science had played a positive role in the response to the pandemic, creating a clear ‘line of sight’ between open science and societal benefits. Whilst the arguments about open science deployed in the debate were not substantially new, the focuses of debate changed in some key respects. There was much less attention given to business models for open access and critical perspectives on open science, but open data sharing, preprinting, information quality and misinformation became most prominent in debates. There were also moves to reframe open science conceptually, particularly in connecting science with society and addressing broader questions of equity.",Materials Science,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s41599-024-03804-w,2
"This study aimed to compare and contrast seven middle school science teachers’ science and engineering integration and the extent of the conceptual link they made between science and engineering by analyzing pre- and post-unit plans and interviews. The training provided to the participants had theoretical and practical aspects, and lasted 14 weeks. Deductive analysis was conducted using existing codes proposed by Pleasants et al. (Int J STEM Educ, 8:1–17, 2021), which capture the extent and quality of explicit connections between science concepts and design practices (i.e., deep, shallow connections). The results revealed that no deep connection was observed in the pre-plans. In addition, only four pre-plans integrated the engineering design process (EDP) into science in the plans. All the teachers integrated EDP into the science units in their post-plans. Moreover, five teachers were able to make a deep connection between the two in the post-plans. The engineering integration and STEM training support given to teachers should explicitly show how science content and engineering design can be conceptually connected.",Materials Science,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11165-025-10306-5,2
"Machine learning plays an increasingly important role in many areas of chemistry and materials science, being used to predict materials properties, accelerate simulations, design new structures, and predict synthesis routes of new materials. Graph neural networks (GNNs) are one of the fastest growing classes of machine learning models. They are of particular relevance for chemistry and materials science, as they directly work on a graph or structural representation of molecules and materials and therefore have full access to all relevant information required to characterize materials. In this Review, we provide an overview of the basic principles of GNNs, widely used datasets, and state-of-the-art architectures, followed by a discussion of a wide range of recent applications of GNNs in chemistry and materials science, and concluding with a road-map for the further development and application of GNNs.",Materials Science,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1038/s43246-022-00315-6,2

"Combinatorial synthesis and high-throughput characterization have become powerful tools to accelerate the discovery and design of novel materials. Correctly extracting information about the constituent phases and gaining materials insight from high-throughput X-ray diffraction data of combinatorial libraries is a crucial step in establishing the composition–structure–property relationship. Basic information includes the number, identity, and fraction of present phases in all the samples, while advanced information includes the lattice change, texture information, solid solution behavior, etc. Encoding domain-specific knowledge, such as crystallography, X-ray diffraction, thermodynamics, kinetics, and solid-state chemistry, into automated algorithms is crucial for the development of automated phase mapping algorithms. In this study, we present an unsupervised optimization-based solver to tackle the phase mapping challenge in high-throughput X-ray diffraction datasets. Besides leveraging robust fitting abilities of neural-network optimization algorithms, we integrated various material information, including first-principles calculated thermodynamic data, crystallography, X-ray diffraction, and texture into our automated solver. Our approach exhibits robust performance across multiple experimental datasets. We emphasize the importance of correctly integrating material information for automated solvers, contributing to the development of future automated characterization tools.",Materials Science,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1038/s41524-025-01837-6,2
"Large language models (LLMs) create exciting possibilities to accelerate scientific discovery and knowledge dissemination in materials science. While LLMs have been successfully applied to select scientific problems and rudimentary challenges, they currently fall short of being practical materials science tools. In this Perspective, we show relevant failure cases of LLMs in materials science that reveal the current limitations of LLMs related to comprehending and reasoning over complex, interconnected materials science knowledge. Given these shortcomings, we outline a framework for developing materials science LLMs (MatSci-LLMs) that are grounded in domain knowledge, which can enable hypothesis generation followed by hypothesis testing for impactful materials science challenges. The path to attaining performant MatSci-LLMs rests, in large part, on building high-quality, multimodal datasets sourced from scientific literature, where various information extraction challenges persist. As such, we describe key materials science information extraction challenges that need to be overcome to build large-scale, multimodal datasets that capture valuable materials science principles and broader knowledge.",Materials Science,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1038/s42256-025-01058-y,2

"Science is often perceived as an objective, apolitical, and static body of knowledge, rather than a set of practices for understanding how and why the world works. Teaching science through social justice science issues (SJSIs) can facilitate a more complex and nuanced understanding of science while supporting children to recognize how science can be a tool to either oppress or push against injustice. Integrating science and social justice movements, however, can be challenging for early career teachers, and particularly elementary teachers. For this qualitative study, five preservice elementary teachers grappled with how they might advise a colleague to teach science through one social justice science issue—a train derailment in a nearby state. In foregrounding an SJSI for a hypothetical lesson, teachers shared affordances and challenges to this work, illuminating and exploring three boundaries: (1) boundaries of what counts as science; (2) boundaries of one’s own knowledge; and (3) boundaries of one’s role as a teacher.

"In the post-COVID-19 era, information education with highly interactive teaching methods has become increasingly common. In particular, the metaverse and virtual reality (VR) technology can be used in novel learning methods to leverage the intuitiveness, immersivity, and interactivity of VR. For example, students could use VR to simulate scientific experiments in chemistry, biology, or physics that would require handling dangerous chemicals or biological samples, mitigating real-world experimental risks. This study investigated the effective use of emerging technologies in K–12 education through the development of a VR teaching material “Escape from the Material Room” for junior high school students with the goals of cultivating students’ core competencies in self-directed learning and enhance the learning experience. The development process involved two stages: first, 45 university students participated in a preliminary usability assessment, providing feedback that led to minor interface adjustments. Subsequently, 25 junior high school students engaged with the optimized VR material as a supplementary course. Through detailed analysis of system usability, user satisfaction, and learning behavior, the study found that the key factors enhancing the effectiveness of VR teaching materials include interaction design, the intuitiveness of the user interfaces, and the integration of teaching content with learning objectives. The findings highlight the potential of VR to promote educational innovation and enhance the learning experience. By incorporating VR’s unique features, such as immersion and interactivity, into teaching and learning, educators can create more engaging and effective learning environments",Materials Science,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10639-024-13156-2,2
"BackgroundDental materials science is an important core course in undergraduate dental programs which integrates foundational concepts of chemical engineering and materials science into clinical dentistry. The present study aimed to identify relevant dental materials science topics for Malaysian undergraduate dental curricula and to determine their appropriate competency levels in terms of cognitive and psychomotor taxonomies.MethodsPotential dental materials science topics were drafted in alignment with the revised national competency statement. The list of topics was further amended after comparing it with those recommended topics in the literature. Fuzzy Delphi method was applied. Experts were selected based on the different inclusion criteria. They ranked the topics using a five-point Likert scale and recommended the appropriate cognitive and psychomotor levels. Next, fuzzy evaluation was performed. Consensus was deemed for a topic to be included if (a) the average expert agreement was ≥ 75%, (b) the d-construct threshold value for each topic was ≤ 0.2 and (c) the average fuzzy number was ≥ 0.5.ResultsSixty-two experts participated in the study. They accepted 33 out of 36 potential dental materials science topics. The average Likert score and fuzzy number ranged from 3.63 to 4.92 and 0.526 to 0.784, respectively. Furthermore, “Endodontic materials” was ranked as the most significant topic. Meanwhile, many topics required dental students to demonstrate a cognitive level of “Apply” and a psychomotor level of “Guided response”. Based on mean scores, “Impression materials” was rated as the most cognitively demanding topic, whilst “Temporary restorative materials” was the most demanding topic for psychomotor taxonomy.ConclusionThe present study has identified relevant dental materials science topics and their appropriate cognitive and psychomotor levels using the Fuzzy Delphi approach.

"This case study explores how three White teachers from a rural, diverse U.S. district engaged in sustained collaborative discussion to adapt their science instruction using Gholdy Muhammad’s (2020)Cultivating Geniusframework. The teachers demonstrated their use of sociopolitical consciousness as a resource for adapting lessons and reflecting on those adaptations. We built from the assumption that teachers have a wealth of resources, including sociopolitical consciousness, to build and innovate pedagogy. We used qualitative thematic coding to analyze 14 teacher-led 50-min discussions over 5 months. The analysis centered on discussions of instructional adaptations, coded first by Muhammad’s pursuits and then by Freire’s levels of sociopolitical consciousness: (1) awareness of social and political contradictions; (2) motivation--the ability to imagine alternative possibilities; and, (3) action to alter power relationships. Finally, transcripts were reviewed to select representative examples of each theme. Based on teachers’ familiarity, the lesson adaptations were informed by the features of project-based learning: a driving question, sustained inquiry, student collaboration, artifact development, and a culminating solution to the driving question. As researchers took observant roles in each discussion, the teachers responded to one another—not the researchers—and fostered an ongoing understanding of what the pursuits offered them toward understanding their teaching. Findings highlight the potential of teachers’ sociopolitical consciousness as a pedagogical resource. Implications are for further research on eliciting existing teacher sociopolitical consciousness and co-development of those resources.",Materials Science,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11191-025-00697-2,2

"Students’ understanding of the nature of science (NOS) is typically naïve. As such, it is important to introduce students explicitly and often to NOS in the classroom, but also in science educational videos, as students use these videos increasingly to study. However, it is unclear to what extent NOS is present in these videos. As such, this study examines the NOS in science educational videos on YouTube. Videos were selected for three content topics (mitosis, vaccines, and nucleosynthesis) and from periods before, during, and after the COVID-19 pandemic. The videos were transcribed and deductively coded for NOS based on Lederman’s conceptualization of NOS. The results showed that NOS is typically not discussed in the videos, and when it is present, it is typically presented in a partially informed manner. Additionally, while COVID-19 did not significantly impact the overall inclusion of NOS, it did influence certain aspects. We suggest a more informed and explicit incorporation of NOS in educational videos to also introduce NOS to students (and other viewers) in informal and nonformal learning.",Materials Science,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11191-025-00694-5,2

"As global challenges grow more complex and demand interdisciplinary solutions, it is essential that students are capable of grappling with such complexity to prepare for the world they will inherit, such as understanding how sociopolitical factors impact scientific decision-making. In this study, we examine how science teachers describe their decision-making processes when addressing the sociopolitical dimensions of real-world science issues. Using teacher identity as a conduit for exploring the responsibilities teachers considered intrinsic to their role, we asked: in what ways do Guyanese science teachers position themselves as sociopolitical actors through their teaching work? We situated this study in Guyana as this a geographic context under-explored in education literature and focused on six secondary school science teachers. Semi-structured interviews revealed factors that influence science teacher identity, and how their identity reveals the possibilities and tensions for sociopolitical discussion in their classrooms. We conclude with a discussion of the weight of politics in this context and the possible consequences for transformative science education efforts if science teachers are not given a concerted opportunity to reconcile their relationship with politics with their view of science.",Materials Science,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11422-025-10263-5,2
"Implementation science offers a systematic approach to bridging the gap between research and clinical practice by promoting the adoption, scale-up, and sustainment of evidence-based therapies. Historically, academic implementation science efforts in the USA have focused on later-stage post-market research through government-funded initiatives, leaving untapped opportunities to engage more proactively with life science partners, such as pharmaceutical sponsors, earlier in the development process. Limited integration with life science partners, especially during early-phase clinical trials, represents a missed opportunity to address implementation challenges that affect real-world uptake proactively. The objective of this current opinion is to explore how implementation scientists can more effectively position their expertise to support the development, evaluation, and delivery of new therapies throughout the entire clinical trial lifecycle with life science partners. This article proposes a conceptual framework for collaboration between implementation scientists and life science partners, emphasizing how early integration can help identify healthcare system constraints, clinician adoption barriers, and patient acceptability issues, factors that often shape a therapy’s downstream impact. Even before efficacy or regulatory certainty is established, implementation science can strengthen trial design, inform site and stakeholder selection, and enhance the interpretability and readiness of findings for real-world uptake. By aligning implementation methodologies with the strategic priorities of pharmaceutical sponsors, academic researchers can provide structured actionable insights that increase the likelihood of clinical and commercial success. Stronger partnerships established earlier in the development process may improve return on investment, reduce time to impact, and accelerate the translation of effective therapies into routine care.",Materials Science,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40290-025-00581-y,2

"In this comment, we review six recently published papers in the Journal of Materials Science: Materials in Electronics, reporting on the growth of “new” amino acid-based crystals viz. “l-methionine potassium hydrogen phthalate” (1), “l-methionine barium nitrate” (2), “l-asparagine monohydrate potassium dichromate” (3), “l-asparagine monohydrate lithium sulphate” (4), “l-phenylalanine lithium sulphate” (5) and “l‑cysteine hydrochloride monohydrate lithium sulphate” (6). All these so-called novel crystals (1)–(6) were characterized based on unit cell data. A critical analysis of the experimental results in these publications reveal that (1) is potassium hydrogen phthalate C8H5O4K, (2) is barium nitrate Ba(NO3)2, (3) and (4) arel-asparagine monohydratel-C4H8N2O3·H2O and (5) and (6) are lithium sulphate monohydrate Li2SO4·H2O, respectively, based on unit cell parameters. Taking (1)–(6) as examples we highlight the importance of single crystal X-ray structure determination for unambiguous characterization of new materials and suggest reporting chemical formula in the abstract of the publication.",Materials Science,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10854-023-11514-3,2

"Epistemic beliefs of science (EBS) are considered to have a strong influence on how science teachers view science itself and carry out science teaching. To this end, Bhutanese primary science teachers, as much as secondary science teachers, are expected to possess sophisticated EBS. While this is one of the aims of the Bhutanese science education system, there is little to no information regarding Bhutanese primary science teachers’ EBS. Hence, this cross-sectional study examined EBS held by primary science teachers from three districts in Bhutan. One hundred and ninety-five (N= 195) primary science teachers took part in the study using a total population sampling design. Data collected using the Epistemic Beliefs of Science Questionnaire (EBSQ) were analysed using descriptive and inferential statistical methods. Findings revealed that Bhutanese primary science teachers from three districts in Bhutan held naive EBS in several aspects of source, certainty, development, and justification dimensions of scientific knowledge. The chi-square test of independence (χ2) revealed that there were no significant relationships between Bhutanese primary science teachers’ EBS and their teaching background (p> .05). The one-way analysis of variance (one-way ANOVA), while showed significant differences in certainty dimension, revealed that were no significant differences among Bhutanese primary science teachers’ EBS in other dimensions based on their academic qualifications (p> .05). The implications of research findings to the Ministry of Education, science curriculum documents, and teacher preparation are discussed.",Materials Science,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11191-024-00563-7,2
"The expansive production of data in materials science, their widespread sharing and repurposing requires educated support and stewardship. In order to ensure that this need helps rather than hinders scientific work, the implementation of the FAIR-data principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) must not be too narrow. Besides, the wider materials-science community ought to agree on the strategies to tackle the challenges that are specific to its data, both from computations and experiments. In this paper, we present the result of the discussions held at the workshop on “Shared Metadata and Data Formats for Big-Data Driven Materials Science”. We start from an operative definition of metadata, and the features that  a FAIR-compliant metadata schema should have. We will mainly focus on computational materials-science data and propose a constructive approach for theFAIRificationof the (meta)data related to ground-state and excited-states calculations, potential-energy sampling, and generalized workflows. Finally, challenges with theFAIRificationof experimental (meta)data and materials-science ontologies are presented together with an outlook of how to meet them.",Materials Science,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1038/s41597-023-02501-8,2

"The recent Nature of Science (NOS) approach that was extended from the “Family Resemblance Approach (FRA) to NOS” (Irzik & Nola,2014) is the Reconceptualized Family Resemblance Approach to Nature of Science (RFN) (Erduran & Dagher,2014; Kaya & Erduran,Science & Education, 25(9), 1115–1133,2016). It is a holistic framework consisting of the cognitive-epistemic and the social-institutional system of science. One of the purposes of the study is to explore science teachers’ views on NOS from the RFN perspective. Additionally, science teachers’ views on the inclusion of NOS in the Turkish science curriculum and science teachers’ NOS implementations were investigated in the present study. The interview and the RFN Questionnaire were conducted with ten science teachers. Although science teachers have high or moderate levels of NOS understanding, some limited or naïve views about NOS were revealed. The NOS inclusion in the Turkish science curriculum was seen as limited, especially for the social-institutional system of science by science teachers. Furthermore, science teachers’ implementations in a classroom do not include the social-institutional system. The study has some implications and suggestions for further studies.",Materials Science,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11191-024-00566-4,2
"With the rise of self-driving labs (SDLs) and automated experimentation across chemical and materials sciences, there is a considerable challenge in designing the best autonomous lab for a given problem based on published studies alone. Determining what digital and physical features are germane to a specific study is a critical aspect of SDL design that needs to be approached quantitatively. Even when controlling for features such as dimensionality, every experimental space has unique requirements and challenges that influence the design of the optimal physical platform and algorithm. Metrics such as optimization rate are therefore not necessarily indicative of the capabilities of an SDL across different studies. In this perspective, we highlight some of the critical metrics for quantifying performance in SDLs to better guide researchers in implementing the most suitable strategies. We then provide a brief review of the existing literature under the lens of quantified performance as well as heuristic recommendations for platform and experimental space pairings.",Materials Science,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1038/s41467-024-45569-5,2
"We present the Novel-Materials-Discovery (NOMAD) Artificial-Intelligence (AI) Toolkit, a web-browser-based infrastructure for the interactive AI-based analysis of materials-science findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR) data. The AI Toolkit readily operates on the FAIR data stored in the central server of the NOMAD Archive, the largest database of materials-science data worldwide, as well as locally stored, users’ owned data. The NOMAD Oasis, a local, stand-alone server can be also used to run the AI Toolkit. By using Jupyter notebooks that run in a web-browser, the NOMAD data can be queried and accessed; data mining, machine learning, and other AI techniques can be then applied to analyze them. This infrastructure brings the concept of reproducibility in materials science to the next level, by allowing researchers to share not only the data contributing to their scientific publications, but also all the developed methods and analytics tools. Besides reproducing published results, users of the NOMAD AI toolkit can modify the Jupyter notebooks toward their own research work.",Materials Science,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1038/s41524-022-00935-z,2
"The discovery of magnetic materials with high operating temperature ranges and optimized performance is essential for advanced applications. Current data-driven approaches are limited by the lack of accurate, comprehensive, and feature-rich databases. This study aims to address this challenge by using Large Language Models (LLMs) to create a comprehensive, experiment-based, magnetic materials database named the Northeast Materials Database (NEMAD), which consists of 67,573 magnetic materials entries (www.nemad.org). The database incorporates chemical composition, magnetic phase transition temperatures, structural details, and magnetic properties. Enabled by NEMAD, we trained machine learning models to classify materials and predict transition temperatures. Our classification model achieved an accuracy of 90% in categorizing materials as ferromagnetic (FM), antiferromagnetic (AFM), and non-magnetic (NM). The regression models predict Curie (Néel) temperature with a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.87 (0.83) and a mean absolute error (MAE) of 56K (38K). These models identified 25 (13) FM (AFM) candidates with a predicted Curie (Néel) temperature above 500K (100K) from the Materials Project. This work shows the feasibility of combining LLMs for automated data extraction and machine learning models to accelerate the discovery of magnetic materials.",Materials Science,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1038/s41467-025-64458-z,2

"In ongoing science education, utilising informal learning environments such as science centres has emerged as a crucial strategy to enhance learners’ engagement and understanding of complex scientific concepts. However, despite their evident benefits, out-of-school learning environments often fail to produce lasting improvements in learners’ understanding of scientific concepts, largely due to inadequate integration with classroom teaching and a lack of strategic planning. This qualitative study, grounded in a moderate constructivist framework, investigates the perspectives of high school science teachers regarding the significant influence and strategic optimization of science centre visits. Through interviews and document analysis, informed by thematic analysis methodology, the study examines teachers’ perceptions and their prior practices when visiting the science centre. Teachers articulate a compelling narrative of how science centre visits serve as catalysts for active, experiential learning, and bridging the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application. Furthermore, the study identifies and describes five strategic imperatives aimed at enhancing the effectiveness of science centre visits in science education. These imperatives encompass pre-visit curriculum integration, differentiated learning activities, teacher-led guided exploration, parental involvement, and continuous evaluation and improvement. Grounded in constructivist principles and contemporary educational theories, these strategies offer an inclusive framework to enrich learners’ learning experiences, cultivate their scientific curiosity, and foster a profound and enduring appreciation for the details of science. These findings highlight how crucial it is for teachers to have access to continual professional development opportunities and institutional support to enable them to fully utilise the pedagogical potential of science centre visits in science curricula.",Materials Science,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s43031-024-00117-5,2
"The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into K-12 education is gaining momentum for its potential to enhance AI literacy among students. This study, conducted in a professional development program context, analyzed the approaches teachers took to integrate task-specific AIs into science instructions based on what they learned through PD experiences. Specifically, we focused on the approaches teachers highlighted and discussed in their individual Peer Teaching Videos (PTVs), created as the final learning outcomes of the PD. PTVs are 15–20 min videos showcasing their AI-integrated science instruction for fellow teachers, produced with guidance from the PD instructor and shared on an online platform. Using constant comparative content analysis of PTVs, along with data from surveys and interviews, we identified three approaches teachers used to engage students with AI. These approaches differed in the positionality and depth of integrating AI in students’ science learning: (1) Trying out AI as a digital tool, (2) Training and testing AI as an inquiry practice partner, and (3) Exploring AI as an epistemic system. Although these approaches were initially developed for integrating task-specific AIs, they hold significant relevance in the context of the current surge in the use of generative AI. Specifically, these findings offer instructional implications for integrating AI not only as a technological tool but also in ways that promote a critical understanding of the epistemic processes and outcomes fostered by engaging with both science and AI.",Materials Science,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11165-025-10233-5,2
"Against the backdrop of the Chinese government’s efforts to become a global science and technology leader, the Sino-American trade war, and debates around Chinese technology firms, this article contributes a qualitative, empirical investigation of the complex nature of Chinese industry-science collaboration abroad. It investigates how science, foreign policy and corporate globalization policies have unfolded in practice on—and under—the ground, leading to multi-faceted collaborations between a Chinese company’s research and development (R&D) department and foreign research institutions. This article focuses on the case of Huawei Technologies in Switzerland, in particular on the company’s 5G Joint Innovation Center and the Huawei Zurich Research Center. Switzerland is a particularly interesting case because the country hosts numerous international organizations and continental Europe’s top university, and has long played an important role as a Chinese diplomatic, scientific, and economic gateway to Europe. Methodologically, the article draws on ethnographic, media, and documentary research conducted between 2019 and 2023, including observations and interviews with Swiss and Chinese experts in the Information and Communication Technology (ICT) field. Drawing attention to the complex interconnection between the two countries’ economic, political, and scientific interests, the article argues that science is both impacted by foreign policy and used to impact policy abroad, making it a key arena for understanding China’s global engagement.",Materials Science,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11024-025-09611-0,2
"This study aims to examine the connection of culturally relevant science pedagogy to school science teaching in Nepali context. A library research and meta-analysis approach was employed to gather relevant books, articles, reports, and theories on Culturally Relevant Science Teaching (CRST) to explore its connection to sociocultural knowledge in science teaching. The findings of the study indicate that CRST necessitates the integration of sociocultural knowledge to help students develop socio-political consciousness. Both Vedic and Ethno-science contain significant socio-culturally embedded science, with spiritual practices being one example. The education policy of Nepal also advocates for the inclusion of such spiritual science in the school science curriculum. However, curriculum designers, textbook writers, students, and teachers demonstrate reluctance to incorporate these elements into the curriculum. Without integrating historically and socioculturally emerged science into the modern school science curriculum, it is not possible to link CRST to the socio-political consciousness of students. These findings imply that science teachers require further input in designing culturally relevant activities that connect to school science, which can be provided through professional development programs.",Materials Science,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s44217-024-00356-8,2
"We describe scientific understanding in a project-based learning (PBL) environment as the context for developing cognitive flexibility through social constructivism and meaningful problem solving, which we argue are required for science learning as described in reform documents. Cognitive flexibility enables students to respond to ill-structured problems by recognizing different ideas as possible solution pathways. Building on research showing that cognitive flexibility supports literacy achievement through adaptive decision-making, we focus on instruction that engages students in seeking multiple scientific ideas to address the same phenomenon or problem in collaborative settings. We developed and validated an instrument to measure cognitive flexibility, designed in conjunction with our PBL curriculum, and examined its predictive relationship with science and literacy achievement among 781 diverse third graders. Using expert review and confirmatory factor analysis, we established the instrument’s validity and reliability. Results show that cognitive flexibility significantly predicts science achievement (β = .269, p <.001) and literacy achievement (β = .489, p <.001), with consistent effects across student demographic groups. Our findings suggest that PBL offers authentic opportunities for students to develop cognitive flexibility alongside scientific understanding and literacy. We discuss implications for designing integrated learning environments that promote cognitive flexibility as a critical skill for problem-solving in science and literacy contexts.",Materials Science,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s43031-025-00131-1,2
"This study investigates the impact of interactive science workshops participation on primary school children's emotions and attitudes towards science. The sample consisted of 186 students aged 9 to 13 from five different schools. The interactive science workshops consisted of a series of practical, active, and hands-on workshops where primary school students could learn about different aspects of science. These workshops, designed and conducted by prospective teachers from the Primary Education degree program, were non-competitive and did not involve participants in competitive activities. Using pre- and post-event questionnaires, changes in emotions and science-related attitudes were assessed. Results indicated a significant increase in positive emotions such as joy and enthusiasm, alongside a reduction in negative emotions like boredom and anxiety. Specifically, the post-test results showed a higher interest in discussing science, greater appreciation for experiments, and an increased desire for science-related careers. These changes were statistically significant, accentuating the transformative potential of interactive, hands-on learning experiences. The findings highlight the importance of integrating such activities into primary education curricula to enhance students' engagement and promote positive perceptions of science.",Materials Science,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10763-024-10539-2,2
"This systematic review study investigated the research on the use of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) tools in science education. The Web of Science database was screened by study titles and abstracts. In total, 41 peer-reviewed articles were included. The researchers created the coding scheme in light of GenAI use in education and science education literature. Results revealed that with 12 studies, most of the research was conducted in chemistry education. The highest frequency of the intended use was to evaluate GenAI tools’ performance in tasks (e.g., solving physics problems), whereas very few studies aimed at enriching science teaching (n= 1). Regarding student-centeredness, only five studies let learners use the technology without any direction, whereas in seven studies, learners’ use was guided. Concerning the level of use, in 14 studies, GenAI use was at a replacement level. The assessment was primarily focused on the instructional component in 23 papers. Most of the studies conducted with GenAI tools did not include participants (n= 20). Quantitative methods (n= 17) were preferred over qualitative ones (n= 10). Based on the results, the use of GenAI tools in science education seems to be in its infancy. At this stage, interdisciplinary partnerships between technology and science educators are necessary. In future research, science educators should focus more on using GenAI tools to enrich science instruction (e.g., how to enhance learners’ arguments, how GenAI tool use affects learners’ argument formation, and how GenAI tools can enrich the history and nature of science instruction).",Materials Science,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11191-025-00677-6,2
"Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) holds promise as a tool to assist teachers in addressing specific instructional design and implementation tasks. This study explores how teachers in a master’s-level elementary science methods course used Large Language Model AI, as one type of GenAI, to design lessons fostering students’ environmental science agency (ESA). The course introduced ESA as one of pedagogical constructs that emphasize the importance of science learning relevant and consequential to students’ lives, and encouraged teachers to use GenAI for their ESA-focused lesson design projects. Data sources included surveys, lesson design documents, GenAI chat logs, and field notes. Findings, derived through constant comparative analysis, highlight GenAI’s utility in three areas: (1) deepening teachers’ conceptual understanding; (2) developing detailed content of lesson components; and (3) integrating ESA into science instruction. Teachers also reported the challenges they encountered and addressed mainly in two ways: (1) ensuring the quality of GenAI-generated responses and (2) aligning these responses with their specific lesson visions. These findings were discussed in terms of teacher perspectives on ESA integration and their effort to take authorship and responsibility in their project process and outcomes. The study concludes by calling for follow-up teacher education practice and research focused on creating science learning opportunities, including those with proper and ethical use of GenAI, that go beyond knowledge enhancement to fostering civic participation aimed at justice-oriented and transformative changes, as envisioned by the concept and practices of ESA.",Materials Science,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11165-025-10262-0,2
"Writing lesson plans is a required competency for pre-service science teachers, and various factors may influence how they convey the Nature of Science (NOS) in their lesson plans. However, it is unclear whether this is related to their understanding of the NOS. This study surveyed 45 pre-service biology teachers in Mainland China using the Reconceptualized Family Resemblance Approach to the Nature of Science (RFN). It also analyzed lesson plans they designed for teaching the NOS. The results demonstrated that (1) teachers’ performance in incorporating NOS elements into their lesson plans was not satisfactory, considering the low frequency of NOS incorporation and incomplete presentation of NOS categories; (2) the ability to integrate the NOS into lesson plans was higher among teachers with a thorough comprehension of the subject than among those with more limited understanding; and (3) teachers tended to incorporate scientific practice and the social-institutional system into lesson plans, while neglecting the aims and values category, despite exhibiting similar understanding all RFN framework categories. This study empirically demonstrates that education programs should give pre-service science teachers more guidance on lesson-planning for teaching the NOS.",Materials Science,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10763-025-10614-2,2
"This study explored secondary science teachers’ attending and interpretation of three science and engineering practices (SEPs) occurring in a classroom setting. This data were further examined to see if teaching experience and disciplinary area influenced the secondary science teachers attending and interpretation of the SEPs. The data collection process involved having teachers talk about the science instruction they viewed in short videos. The videos highlighted three SEPs: developing and using models, analyzing and interpreting data, and engaging in argument from evidence (see NGSS Lead States,2013). A mixed-method analysis was used to examine the responses of teachers. From this analysis, there were four important conclusions. First, most science teachers struggled to provide full descriptions of the SEPs in the videos. Second, being able to describe an SEP, at least partially, often coincided with a higher level of interpretation of the SEP. Third, the disciplinary area of the teachers did not pose a barrier in their ability to point out and talk about an SEP. Fourth, preliminary evidence suggested that new science teachers had more sophisticated discussions about the SEPs than their experienced science teacher counterparts. This study found evidence that science teachers are still building their knowledge of the SEPs, attending and interpretation are connected, and that attending and noticing of the SEPs may not be content specific. These findings have implications for the ongoing learning of teachers.",Materials Science,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10763-025-10548-9,2

"Nature of science (NOS) conception and science self-efficacy (SSE) are among the components of scientific literacy and the professional competency of science teachers. In this study, pre-service science teachers (PSSTs) (n= 145) NOS conception, SSE, and the relationships among these constructs were explored. Moreover, the existence of differences in the construct in gender, scientific disciplines, and year levels was investigated. We used the instruments Students Understanding of Science and Scientific Inquiry Scale (SUSSI) for NOS conception and the SSE scale for SSE data collection, and mean comparisons and Spearman correlation for the analysis. PSST’s overall NOS conception and SSE were found to be less informed and moderate, respectively. Specifically, they have an uninformed conception of the NOS theme’s distinction between law and theory, and scientific methodology. PSST’s NOS conception was not significantly influenced by differences in year level, gender, or science disciplines, but SSE was significantly influenced by year levels. Overall NOS conception and SSE did not show a statistically significant correlation. However, SSE was found to be positively correlated with scientific theory tentativeness and negatively correlated with distinction between scientific laws and theories themes of NOS. These findings indicate that the development of NOS conception and SSE among PSST needs attention from science curriculum developers and science teacher educators. Furthermore, it showed the necessity for consideration of independent development strategies for NOS conceptions and SSE.",Materials Science,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11191-024-00543-x,2
"The development of nanoporous metals and metallic composites through dealloying processes presents significant opportunities in materials engineering. However, designing multicomponent precursor alloys and establishing corresponding processing methods that yield predictable compositions and nanostructures remain a complex challenge. This article explores how machine learning (ML)-augmented computational and experimental methodologies can tackle these challenges by predicting precursor alloy compositions, final nanoporous structures, and mechanical properties, while integrating ML-enabled autonomous experimentation for material design and quantification. We highlight recent advancements in applying ML to nanostructured materials design via dealloying and discuss how techniques from other nanomaterial designs can be adapted for improved control over morphological and compositional outcomes in nanoporous and nanocomposite materials. Furthermore, we explore the role of ML in autonomous synchrotron x-ray experimentation, enabling real-time feedback between modeling and experimental setups. ML-driven approaches to microstructure characterization and mechanical property prediction are also examined, with a focus on modeling and advanced imaging techniques such as three-dimensional nanotomography.

"An overall rise in the citation parameters used in the metrics of scientific publications (i.e. journal impact factor,JIF) has taken place since the last decade of the previous century, coinciding with the electronic distribution of (and access to) scientific literature. This inflation like tendency is herein analyzed in the area of Materials Science and also affects the number of publications. Considering averageJIFvalues, its growth is proportional to the number of publications in the area and to itsJIFvalue, leading to an inhomogeneous boost that preferentially benefits those journals with highJIF. An elevation in the number of publications per year alone cannot explain this behavior but it occurs due to a continuous and widespread increment in the number of citations per article, which only remains limited when restrictions are applied by journals to the maximum number of pages per article. In this work we observe this positive correlation between the increase in the number of references per article and the overall increase in JIF but, in our analysis, a kink point is observed in consistency with the appearance of online databases, particularly those free available in 2004.

"In the decade following the release of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada’s multi-volume final report and94 Calls to Action, we have seen a nation-wide intensification of earlier educational policy reform around Indigenous perspectives, albeit unevenly across institutional spaces: science education is one of such spaces marked by paucity. In exploring the central questionCan there be a science education for reconciliation?, this manuscript makes the case that in few instances in which reconciliation surfaces in science education, it deflects responsibility from addressing the TRC’s central yet more unsettling demands: directly addressing residential schools, their legacies, and their logics of settler colonialism. Thinking with Indigenous critiques of reconciliation and of science education, some lines of questioning are offered:What is the science of residential schools? How dothinking like a scientist and the logics of residential schools intersect? How might we continuetopush reconciliation-as-inclusion further?",Materials Science,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s42330-025-00418-5,2
"Frontier scientific discoveries increasingly rely on big-science research infrastructures, such as supercolliders, synchrotron light sources, and space telescopes, whose construction and operation involve intensive international collaboration. This collaborative nature, however, presents a challenge in balancing national interests with the common good, particularly given the substantial fiscal investments involved. This study investigates the effects of one of China’s prominent big-science infrastructures, the Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility (SSRF), on the country’s production of science, differentiating between national and international scientific endeavors. Employing a rigorous difference-in-differences (DID) methodology, it evaluates SSRF’s effects on discipline-level production of publications by domestic researchers and those involving international collaboration. The empirical findings reveal compelling evidence that SSRF has significantly enhanced the production of high-impact national and international publications for disciplines reliant on the facility for experiments, particularly increasing the percentage of high-impact national publications. The findings also underscore the dual role of big-science infrastructures in fostering international research collaboration while simultaneously enhancing nations’ domestic scientific development and competitiveness. Additionally, the study provides valuable insights for research assessment and science policy discussions.",Materials Science,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s41599-024-03993-4,2
"Developing high-performance rechargeable batteries requires a revolutionary advancement in battery materials, guided by a fundamental understanding of their underlying science and mechanisms. However, this task remains a challenge owing to the complex relationship among composition, structure and property in electrode and electrolyte materials. Ionic potential, a concept derived from geochemistry, has been incorporated into battery materials research since 2020 as a methodology for predicting and optimizing their functional properties. Defined as the ratio of charge number of an ion to its ionic radius, ionic potential serves as a measure of the interaction strength within the structure of a material. In this Perspective, we explore the role of ionic potential in guiding the design of advanced materials for rechargeable batteries. Specifically, we discuss how integrating ionic potential into material design frameworks can capture critical structural interactions, thereby enabling improvements in properties such as ionic conductivity, redox activity and phase transition behaviours. Furthermore, we identify the broader relevance of ionic potential in battery systems, highlighting its potential in advancing fundamental understanding and performance capabilities in battery technology.",Materials Science,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1038/s41578-025-00822-1,2
"Abstract—Machine learning (ML) has proven to be a powerful tool, significantly speeding up and simplifying the development of new materials while enhancing their functional characteristics. In recent years, there has been an exponential growth in the number of scientific publications exploring the use of ML in materials science. Using this approach, various materials, including magnetic ones, are being actively developed and studied. This article aims to critically review research that applies ML to predict the functional characteristics of soft and hard magnetic materials. The paper is divided into three sections: the first outlines the basic principles and algorithms of machine learning, highlighting its use in addressing practical materials science challenges; the second discusses recent advances in developing magnetic functional alloys using ML; the last section provides a critical analysis of the use of machine learning methods in this area, analyzes its advantages and disadvantages, and gives recommendations for organizing such research.",Materials Science,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1134/S0031918X24601471,2
"Pictographs, and the landscape formations they are featured upon, are culturally significant places among Indigenous communities. Here, we present the results of a field survey and compositional analysis of pictographs and the mineral pigments used to produce them at Babine Lake (British Columbia), in the traditional territory claimed by the Lake Babine Nation, the Tl’azt’en Nation, and the Yekooche Nation. The monochrome motifs are produced with iron oxide mineral pigments (red ochre), and are all painted on prominent, open-air rock faces overlooking deep water. This study also includes collection and analysis of red ochre pigment sources within the area for comparison to the pictographs. Using a series of microanalytical methods applied to the local raw materials and rock art paints, we offer insights into characteristics of pigment materiality, such as artistic selection of minerals with different physicochemical properties and thechaîne opératoireof paint preparation. Our results show that rock art painters active at Babine Lake chose a diversity of iron oxide types to produce different pigment mixtures with distinctive properties, including the harvesting and thermal enhancement of iron-rich biominerals from colonies of aquatic, iron-oxide-producing bacteria.",Materials Science,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12520-024-01953-2,2
"As terms like theScience of ReadingandScience of Learninggain prominence in education policy and practice, there is a growing need to clarify what learning entails at a cognitive systems level. In this perspective review, we argue that meaningful instructional practice, particularly in the context of artificial intelligence (AI), must align with the distinct yet interacting memory systems that support human learning across development. Drawing on cognitive science, neuroscience, and educational psychology research, we provide a functional overview of implicit and explicit memory systems and examine their relevance for literacy development. We then frame Structured Literacy within the instructional hierarchy, illustrating how each learning phase (i.e., acquisition, fluency, generalization, adaptation) involves specific learning mechanisms and instructional demands. Finally, we evaluate how AI tools may support or undermine these processes and propose phase-specific approaches to responsible integration. AI should be judged not by its technical sophistication, but by its capacity to support memory systems, preserve teacher agency, and promote lasting, transferable literacy outcomes, especially for vulnerable learners. These are empirical questions. This perspective review is intended to motivate future research into Structured Literacy framed within a more expansive understanding of the science of learning and the responsible, efficacious use of AI in education.",Materials Science,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11881-025-00345-y,2
"Advanced materials hold great promise, but their adoption is impeded by the challenges of developing, characterizing, and modeling them, then of designing, processing, and producing something with them. Even if the results are open, the means to do each of these steps are typically proprietary and segregated. We show how principles of open-source software and hardware can be used to develop open instrumentation for materials science, so that a measurement can be accompanied by a complete computational description of how to reproduce it. And then we show how this approach can be extended to effectively measure predictive computational models rather than just model parameters. We refer to these interrelated concepts as “computational metrology.” These are illustrated with examples including a 3D printer that can do rheological characterization of unfamiliar and variable materials.Graphical abstractA demonstration of computational metrology is shown through the development of a Rheoprinter (left) that combines off-the-shelf printer components with custom instrumentation.

"In recent years, increasing attention to the nature of science (NOS) alongside a growing interest in understanding how social-institutional dimensions of science are represented in educational materials has become a fundamental objective in science education curricula. The present study aims to contribute to this research field by examining the presence and absence of these dimensions within Iranian high school science textbooks. The thirteen science textbooks were analyzed within the social-institutional parameters of the expanded Family Resemblance Approach (FRA), utilizing content analysis as the research design. The results revealed, while not extensively represented, there are discernible traces of the social-institutional dimensions of science in Iranian high school science textbooks; however, these elements appear to be somewhat narrow in some categories. The results also indicated a significant imbalance in the representation of the dimensions across the science textbooks. In particular, the findings showed that most social-institutional aspects of science are predominantly associated with the components of “professional activities” and “organizations and social interactions.” Conversely, the least representation was observed in the “social certification and dissemination” categories and “political power structures.” In more detail, critical sub-categories such as freedom, social quality control, and race were absent, highlighting a gap in the educational discourse surrounding the social dimensions of science.

"Centralized laboratories in which analytical processes are automated to enable the analysis of large numbers of samples at relatively low cost are used for analytical testing throughout the world. However, healthcare is changing, partly due to the general recognition that care needs to be more patient-centered and putting the patient at the center of action. One way to achieve this goal is to consider point-of-care testing (PoC) devices as alternative analytical concepts. This requires miniaturization of current analytical concepts and the use of cost-effective diagnostic tools with appropriate sensitivity and specificity. Electrochemical sensors are ideally adapted as they provide robust, low-cost, and miniaturized solutions for the detection of variable analytes, yet lack the high sensitivity comparable to more classical diagnosis approaches. Advances in nanotechnology have opened up a plethora of different nanomaterials to be applied as electrode and/or sensing materials in electrochemical biosensors. The choice of materials significantly influences the sensor’s sensitivity, selectivity, and overall performance. A critical review of the state of the art with respect to the development of the utilized materials (between 2019 and 2023) and where the field is heading to are the focus of this article.Graphical abstract",Materials Science,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00216-023-05054-2,2
"Modern society is under increasing threats of natural and technological disasters, which involve complex interactions among science, technology and social structures. Although a scientific understanding of disasters is an immediate global issue, there is limited discussion about how disasters can relate to science education. To address this gap, we report findings from a research study to support preservice science teachers’ learning about disasters and its relevance to science education. Fifteen preservice science teachers participated in a six-hour workshop focused on the scientific and sociotechnical aspects of the humidifier disinfectant disaster, which caused severe lung injuries to half a million people in South Korea. The study aim was to identify preservice science teachers’ perceptions about how disasters can be incorporated into science teaching. The participants were engaged in a series of group activities using the official investigation report, followed by a discussion on the aspects of science, technology, and society that unfolded in the disaster. Our analysis suggested that the participants were able to discover important aspects of the mutual relationship between science and disasters, and propose various cognitive, attitudinal, and functional aims that could be pursued by embedding disasters in science lessons. The lesson plans showed that the participants were able to suggest how to use disasters in science lessons and leverage diverse teaching methods to achieve their lesson goals. However, the shift in their perceptions before and after the workshop was limited. We argue that support is necessary for preservice science teachers to incorporate disasters into the science classroom, by providing more time and resources and lowering the barriers related to the political and traumatic aspects of disasters.",Materials Science,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11422-024-10225-3,2
"This article reviews Loet Leydesdorff’s contributions to science mapping. It explains how over the years, his mapping techniques evolved from journal mapping to global maps of science and finally towards interactive interfaces portraying multiple classifications and ontologies. It then critically reviews the challenges faced by current approaches to science mapping, which implicitly assume a ‘natural’ epistemic structure, with examples from two recent case studies. We observe that bottom-up algorithmic approaches, either based on citation or semantic approaches, lack conceptual consistency regarding the type of categories used: in a same classification a category captures methods, another one has materials, a third one contains empirical objects and a fourth is focused on theories, rather than having a single logic. I argue that science mapping would produce more useful representations by using ontologies based on a single logic that aligns with the particular conceptual needs of the analysis. Novel classification methods based on machine learning and language models hold promise to produce these tailored, question-driven ontologies.",Materials Science,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11192-025-05323-0,2

"This forum is in response to Paula Magee and Craig Willey’s (2024) article, Towards a framework of culturally relevant science and mathematics pedagogy: A pedagogical and analytical tool for teacher education. The researchers use culturally relevant mathematics and science pedagogy (CRSMP) as a framework for assisting science and mathematics teachers in using culture in their teaching. Reflecting on their teaching, it was challenging for their preservice and inservice teachers to identify what they were doing in practice that was evidence of culturally relevant teaching. We introduce historically relevant science pedagogy as a “robust” pedagogical approach that emerged from interviews and Sista Circles with Black women science teachers. Science educators have several tools to challenge how we shape curricular materials, make instructional decisions, and address teacher dispositions. We need to purposefully create a curriculum that allows culture to excite the learning environment toward full engagement and humanity in learning and practice.",Materials Science,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11422-025-10254-6,2
"While archival user studies have largely focused on humanities (and adjacent) scholars, this paper focuses on anthropologists engaged in scientific research. Based on qualitative results from an open-ended survey, we investigate how science-based anthropologists perceive and use archives in their work. We ask: How are science-based anthropologists and archaeologists reusing archival data in their research? What difficulties or barriers do they encounter in reusing archival data in scientific contexts? What attitudes or understandings about archival research are held by science-based anthropologists and archaeologists? Our findings primarily add to the body of literature about user experience in archives and more broadly to the emerging literature on archival data reuse. Major findings include (1) barriers and gatekeeping legacies that impact archival research and the ability of researchers to reuse data and (2) mixed perceptions about archives among researchers. We also discuss suggestions made by these communities of practice, and the ways that barriers to archival data reuse may stem from a lack of knowledge about core archival and information infrastructures among researcher communities. Together, this research showcases possible (re)uses of important primary source data in archives among scientific communities but highlights that barriers to access and misperceptions create a gap in exploiting that potential. We argue for a “re-imagining” of anthropological archives as relevant to contemporary communities and scientific pursuits toward a richer scientific research environment.",Materials Science,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10502-023-09411-z,2

"This article reports on the kind of science that comes into focus in Swedish preschool work teams’ discussions of their participation in a development project called Science Kids. Such knowledge is valuable for future competence development initiatives and the implementation of support materials. The study is conducted in cooperation with a mid-sized Swedish municipality. Empirical data consists of pre- and post-questionnaires and focus-group discussions. Data were analysed through a directed content analysis supported by the framework of curriculum emphases (Roberts,1982). The results show that the work teams highlighted children’s joy in exploring science as the most important aim of science in preschool (children aged 1–5 years). Such aims were, according to the participants, met in the Science Kids, but they also experienced that there was a strong focus on learning the correct science concepts. The participants were ambivalent in relation to the learning of science concepts. On the one hand, they saw opportunities for children to put words on what they encountered in everyday life (such as naming bugs they encountered in the neighbourhood). On the other hand, the teachers worried that a focus on concepts would create a feeling among the children that they had to provide correct answers instead of trying new ideas or daring to ask questions. We discuss implicit messages about science that accompanied the project and provide suggestions for future competence development projects.",Materials Science,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11165-025-10295-5,2

"Scientific practices describe behaviors scientists engage in while investigating the natural world. Educators should be aware of different science practice frameworks to better understand their students' progression for learning science practices across the K-20 spectrum. For example, a high school AP instructor would benefit from understanding both the K-12 frameworks their students have already experienced and the future undergraduate frameworks their students are moving toward. We were interested in exploring educator familiarity with the scientific practices outlined in the Next Generation Science and Engineering Practices, the Advanced Placement Science Practices, and Vision & Change Core Competencies. In practice, all science educators are teaching the same set of core principles around which these different frameworks are built. Under this view, it is a missed opportunity to not consider or draw on different frameworks to expand one’s teaching practice. Using a cognitive constructionist approach, we describe the implementation of the “Science Practice Frameworks Concept Map Activity,” designed to (1) introduce educators to scientific practices contained within Science Practice Frameworks and (2) show educators that despite these science practices targeting different student populations they are, at their core, very similar and often overlap. We present data showing a positive shift in educator familiarity with Science Practice Frameworks and present examples of participant concept maps that help us begin to understand how educators perceive the frameworks and the relationships between them, ensuring that educators are better prepared to guide students through a comprehensive understanding of science practices.",Materials Science,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s44217-024-00325-1,2
"This study examines preservice teachers’ (PSTs) practices of noticing and responding to students’ scientific thinking within the context of their science methods courses (pedagogy focused). The PSTs, in their senior year and later in their student-teaching internship year at a Midwestern university teacher preparation program, participated in two sequential science methods courses. Over the course of these two semesters, they completed two key course assignments: Sensemaking tasks (senior year) and Student learning analysis (internship year). Their written responses to these assignments were evaluated using Kang and Anderson’s (Sci Educ 99(5):863–895,2015) framework, which is designed to study teachers’ practices of noticing and responding. The findings reveal that PSTs primarily focused on their own actions as teachers, their students’ behavior, and the canonical nature of their students’ responses. However, their attention to students’ science ideas was limited, often leading to narrow interpretations when these ideas were noticed. The nature of the methods course assignment prompts may have influenced PSTs to prioritize certain aspects of students’ learning over others. These findings suggest important implications for supporting and enhancing PSTs’ practices of noticing and responding through targeted coursework and the design of methods courses.",Materials Science,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11165-025-10240-6,2

"Global scientific output is expanding exponentially, which in turn calls for a better understanding of the science of science and especially how the boundaries of scientific fields expand through processes of emergence. The present study proposes the application of embedded topic modeling techniques to identify new emerging science via knowledge recombination activities as evidenced through the analysis of research publication metadata. First, a dataset is constructed from metadata derived from the Web of Science Core Collection database. The dataset is then used to generate a global map representing a categorical scientific co-occurrence network. A research field is defined as interdisciplinary when multiple science categories are listed in its description. Second, the co-occurrence networks are subsequently compared between periods to determine changing patterns of influence in light of interdisciplinarity. Third, embedded topic modeling enables unsupervised association of interdisciplinary classification. We present the results of the analysis to demonstrate the emergence of global interdisciplinary sciences and further we perform qualitative validation on the results to identify what the sources of the emergent areas are. Based on these results, we discuss potential applications for identifying emergence through the merging of global interdisciplinary domains.",Materials Science,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s41599-024-03044-y,2

"Early science inquiries and experiences increase young children’s awareness and interest for science. The importance of promoting science process skills which bolster children’s confidence to formulate and communicate personal ideas have been emphasised by international guidelines. As Loose Parts Play (LPP) is a form of free play involving open-ended play materials, its flexible nature promotes active exploration with materials that encourages children’s interaction with science-related experiences. This teacher action research aims to explore the influence of open-ended questions on children’s science process skills, as well as the scientific concepts that children are capable of exploring independently during play experiences. Analyses draw on video- and audio-recorded observation, child observation notes, and teacher journals. A total of 180 open-ended questions were employed by the teacher-researcher and 155 instances of science process skills were observed in a group of five-year-old children. Findings revealed that periods of uninterrupted play time followed by open-ended questions, extend children’s science process skills, and add complexity to their scientific exploration. Furthermore, children were observed to self-initiate exploration of scientific concepts, such as transforming materials and changing motion, during these uninterrupted play periods. Overall, this teacher action research highlights the pivotal role that educators play in young children’s playful learning experiences, where their timely use of open-ended questions has the capacity to facilitate children’s early science learning during LPP. This study serves to define an educator’s role within student-driven or child-initiated learning experiences, as well as guide educators in the utility of loose part materials, provision of uninterrupted play periods, and planning of open-ended questions to stimulate children’s science exploration.",Materials Science,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10643-024-01741-6,2
"Student participation in science discourse requires multiple levels of support through tools such as curricular materials, as well as teacher talk. The actions of the teacher can provide opportunities for students to engage in disciplinary science talk. The norms associated with this talk can be used to define what students sound like when engaged in authentic science talk. However, often talk moves are employed in service of in-the-moment tasks rather than development of disciplinary talk norms. For this study, we focused on the Ambitious Science Teaching–based teacher talk engaged in by two middle school science teachers to support student sensemaking regarding a phenomenon-based science unit with embedded data visualization and simulation software over the course of a 2-week teaching unit. This descriptive case study identifies how differences in the purpose of questioning impacts the patterns of teacher talk regarding establishing norms in support of the norms of progressive discourse. These cases demonstrate two teachers with aligned philosophies, basic skills, and education in Ambitious teacher talk. However, one uses these talk moves to drive activity level sensemaking while the other utilizes talk moves to develop classroom talk norms that reflect the characteristics of progressive discourse. Being responsive to student talk, and being purposeful in organizing patterns of moves, requires being thoughtful of the purposes of specific talk moves, as well as the overall goal of the conversation. Results indicate that teachers should be supported in developing an understanding of the larger patterns of teacher talk to support progressive discourse norm building.",Materials Science,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11191-025-00633-4,2
"Advancing modern technology has propelled biomedicine and materials science to the forefront of scientific interest. As modern science evolves, it demands greater synergy between disciplines. In the realm of orthopaedics, the complex architecture of bone necessitates implants that balance strength with porosity. This dual requirement beckons a profound grasp that spans the realms of biomedicine and materials science, urging a deep dive into both fields to craft the perfect synergy for bone implant materials. Journeying through materials and orthopaedic science, this article systematically discussed the preparation of 3D porous structures by electrospinning technology for orthopaedics. It began by detailing electrospinning techniques, their principles, processes, materials, and design strategies within materials science. Material characterization methods were then presented. In biomedicine, we offered a concise overview of standard testing methods, from cell viability to staining. Building on the foundational knowledge of both fields, it reviewed 3D electrospinning strategies and summarized recent research progress in bone tissue culture with this method. This review sought to offer a structured comprehension of the intersecting disciplines to researchers, establishing a robust basis for material innovation tailored to orthopaedic-specific demands.Graphical abstract",Materials Science,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s42114-024-01120-0,2
"This paper presents an approach to analyzing illustrations of science scenes. These images depict scientists conducting experiments, making discoveries, or presenting their ideas in societal meetings, offices, or the field, often surrounded by objects relevant to their studies. Despite their frequent inclusion in educational and historical materials, such illustrations are often treated as mere embellishments. This paper re-evaluates their significance, demonstrating that they offer valuable historical insights. Focusing on two examples from the history of electricity—illustrations from the works of French abbé Jean Antoine Nollet (1700–1770) depicting theflying boyandLeyden jarexperiments—this study applies theories from art history, methodologies for analyzing visual materials, and perspectives from the new cultural history. By conducting a deep, contextualized analysis, I discuss how these illustrations contribute to a richer understanding of the historical episodes they depict. This study highlights the overlooked potential of illustrations of science scenes and proposes new ways to integrate them into teacher education, encouraging a more nuanced engagement with visual historical sources.",Materials Science,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11191-025-00668-7,2
"Citizen science approaches have grown in popularity over the years, partly due to their ability to reach a wider audience and produce more generalizable samples. In dogs, these studies, though, have been limited in their controls over materials or experimental protocols, with guardians typically reporting results without researcher supervision. Over two studies, we explored and validated a synchronous citizen science approach. We had dog guardians act as experimenters while being supervised by a researcher over Zoom. In study 1, we demonstrated that synchronous citizen science produced equivalent levels of performance to in-lab designs in a choice task. Consistent with past in-lab research, dogs selected a treat (vs. an empty plate) in a two-alternative forced-choice task. In study 2, we showed that Zoom methods are also appropriate for studies utilizing looking time measures. We explored dogs’ looking behaviors when a bag of treats was placed in an unreachable location, and dogs’ guardians were either attentive or inattentive while dogs attempted to retrieve the treats. Consistent with past work, dogs in the attentive condition looked at their guardian for longer periods and had a shorter latency to first look than dogs in the inattentive condition. Overall, we have demonstrated that synchronous citizen science studies with dogs are feasible and produce valid results consistent with those found in a typical lab setting.",Materials Science,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10071-024-01882-6,2

"Eye-tracking technology has emerged as a powerful tool in science education research, providing unparalleled insights into learners’ visual attention, cognitive processing, and engagement with complex visual stimuli. This systematic review synthesises findings from 170 studies published in Web of Science-indexed journals, selected from an initial pool of 525 articles. The analysis reveals that most studies were conducted in Europe (with physics education dominating at 34%) and primarily targeted university students (55%), while only 22% focused on younger learners, including preschool and lower-secondary students. The median sample size across studies was 36 participants, highlighting a methodological constraint that merits attention. The results identify key research themes: the processing of scientific representations (29%), reading behaviours in learning materials (28%), problem-solving tasks (19%), experiments and simulations (18%), and video-based learning environments (6%). Eye-tracking metrics such as fixation duration, dwell time, and transition patterns were predominantly used to measure learners’ attention and cognitive load. Findings underscore the critical influence of learner expertise, prior knowledge, and spatial abilities on visual processing patterns. Novice learners exhibited surface-level engagement, frequent switching between representations, and difficulty integrating visual and textual information, whereas experts demonstrated focused, deeper processing. Instructional interventions were shown to enhance learners’ comprehension and performance significantly. However, challenges persist, including methodological inconsistencies, small sample sizes, and underexplored factors like emotional responses and self-regulation. The review highlights the pressing need for further research that utilises meta-analytical approaches, addresses diverse learner populations, and explores complex learning environments with eye-tracking technology. By offering actionable insights for instructional design and visual learning strategies, this review advances our understanding of how visual stimuli shape learning in science education and paves the way for evidence-based pedagogical innovations.",Materials Science,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11191-025-00644-1,2
"In a paper published in 2020, Philip McCann gives a qualitative overview of “the Nordic contribution to regional science”, which, however, only includes contributions by Swedish regional science researchers. The purpose of this paper is to complement McCann’s overview by highlighting Nordic contributions to regional science in the period 1983–2022 through a bibliometric analysis of publications in a set of thirteen regional science journals indexed inWeb of Science,using several standard bibliometric tools. Our most interesting and surprising result is that the number of “Nordic” publications in the chosen set of journals has grown more than six times faster than the total number of publications in these journals between 1983–1992 and 2013–2022. This implies that the “Nordic” regional science researchers have increased their “market share” from 1.9 to 9.1 per cent. During the same period, the share of co-authored papers increased from 50.0 to 82.9 per cent and the share of international co-authorships increased from 0 to 50.0 per cent and went from being a mainly intra-European activity to a global activity. This process is also reflected in a certain international influence on the research topics during the four periods analysed, but to a considerable extent it seems that the Nordic regional scientists have pursued their own Nordic research themes. In terms of individual research productivity, there was the expected skewed distribution with a small number of researchers with a large research output. At the institutional level, there were notable changes in the ranking of institutions in terms of number of authorships, but one institution—Umeå University—ranked among the Nordic top-2 in all four periods.",Materials Science,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00168-024-01346-2,2

"Recent advancements in artificial intelligence have sparked interest in scientific assistants that could support researchers across the full spectrum of scientific workflows, from literature review to experimental design and data analysis. A key capability for such systems is the ability to process and reason about scientific information in both visual and textual forms—from interpreting spectroscopic data to understanding laboratory set-ups. Here we introduce MaCBench, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating how vision language models handle real-world chemistry and materials science tasks across three core aspects: data extraction, experimental execution and results interpretation. Through a systematic evaluation of leading models, we find that although these systems show promising capabilities in basic perception tasks—achieving near-perfect performance in equipment identification and standardized data extraction—they exhibit fundamental limitations in spatial reasoning, cross-modal information synthesis and multi-step logical inference.

"AbstractManaging, processing, and sharing research data and experimental context produced on modern scientific instrumentation all present challenges to the materials research community. To address these issues, two MaRDA Working Groups on FAIR Data in Materials Microscopy Metadata and Materials Laboratory Information Management Systems (LIMS) convened and generated recommended best practices regarding data handling in the materials research community. Overall, the Microscopy Metadata Group recommends (1) instruments should capture comprehensive metadata about operators, specimens/samples, instrument conditions, and data formation; and (2) microscopy data and metadata should use standardized vocabularies and community standard identifiers. The LIMS Group produced the following guides and recommendations: (1) a cost and benefit comparison when implementing LIMS; (2) summaries of prerequisite requirements, capabilities, and roles of LIMS stakeholders; and (3) a review of metadata schemas and information-storage best practices in LIMS. Together, the groups hope these recommendations will accelerate breakthrough scientific discoveries via FAIR data.Impact statementWith the deluge of data produced in today’s materials research laboratories, it is critical that researchers stay abreast of developments in modern research data management, particularly as it relates to the international effort to make data more FAIR – findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable. Most crucially, being able to responsibly share research data is a foundational means to increase progress on the materials research problems of high importance to science and society. Operational data management and accessibility are pivotal in accelerating innovation in materials science and engineering and to address mounting challenges facing our world, but the materials research community generally lags behind its cognate disciplines in these areas.

"Many have investigated the effectiveness of teaching methods across different disciplines. In a previous study, we found the superior effectiveness of a two-part learning sequence consisting of self-study followed by discussion in humanities education. To examine the possibility of similar findings in science education, we compared that sequence with a traditional lecture–based teaching. Results indicate that self-study combined with discussion yields higher test scores, demonstrating its potential as a beneficial teaching strategy in science education. In Experiment 1, undergraduate students from various disciplines studied introductory biology under five different conditions: self-study and discussion, lecture and discussion, lecture and review, self-study and review, and self-study and review with additional learning materials. Results indicated that the self-study and discussion condition yielded higher test scores than both the lecture and discussion condition and the three review groups. There were no significant differences in scores among the three review groups. These results demonstrate that discussion is an effective learning method and that self-study enhances the benefits of discussion. In Experiment 2, which involved science and engineering majors, we successfully replicated the design of Experiment 1 using physics for the two discussion conditions: self-study or lecture. We also performed in-depth analyses of student interactions during the discussions. Among the two discussion groups, the self-study and discussion group exhibited more active and constructive engagement in sharing unknowns, leading to enhanced learning. These findings suggest that integrating self-study with discussion can significantly enhance learning outcomes in science education. This approach not only improves test performance but also fosters deeper student thinking. Thus, educators might consider adopting this method to create more interactive and effective learning environments in science courses.",Materials Science,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11191-024-00562-8,2

"Materials development is a complex task that may start with a predicted property for a material that exists only in a computer. To arrive at a maturity level for a specific application that will use the material requires substantial synthesis, scale-up, and testing to prove reliability, demonstrate that a new material has the required properties, and thereby gain the trust of the relevant design community. A multi-year process is typically required to reach such an end-state with many cases of failure along the way when funding runs out or an application imposes demands beyond the capability of a given material. This report proposes a framework of Materials Maturity Levels for such a development sequence that systematizes the various stages of materials development and maturation. A spreadsheet is provided as a checklist for evaluating or assessing the current maturity level of a material. The need is explained for increasing involvement of an intended application with advances in maturity, leading to an emphasis on the value of co-design (i.e., that the application and the material should be designed hand-in-hand because each affects the other). The extent to which any given material must be embedded in a composite structure is discussed because this is commonly required for electronic materials (more so than structural materials). Simulation of processing, microstructure, and properties at each level is crucial to track and accelerate the entire maturation process which is well described by the Materials Genome Initiative (MGI). Currently, simulation makes the strongest contribution to materials discovery but is expected to become increasingly useful for predicting development, processing, and manufacturing workflows. This, in turn, points out the importance of verification and validation (V&V) in software tools, as well as uncertainty quantification (UQ).",Materials Science,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40192-025-00413-6,2
"Abstract—The importance of this work is caused by more severe operating conditions of high-temperature products made of heat-resistant sheet alloys, which include, in particular, austenitic chromium–nickel steels. When steel parts are loaded in an oxidizing atmosphere and aggressive media, they must have a high strength, hardness, and heat resistance along with resistance to electrochemical and gas corrosion. These properties are increased by volume and surface hardening methods, which include nitriding. The application of traditional furnace gas nitriding technologies to chromium–nickel steels encounters problems, namely, a low rate of nitrogen saturation, which significantly increases the process time, and the formation of chromium nitrides, which negatively affects corrosion and heat resistance. New nitriding technologies for high-alloyed chromium-containing steels are being developed in the field of intensifying the saturation process and regulating the phase composition of a nitrided layer to minimize the formation of chromium nitrides. The aim of this work is to determine rational technological versions and conditions of high-temperature gas nitriding of austenitic steel in order to increase the strength characteristics at room and elevated temperatures while maintaining its heat resistance. Thermodynamic modeling of the phase composition with the CALPHAD method has shown that the main measures to minimize the precipitation of chromium nitrides at a nitrided surface are an increase in the titanium concentration in steel and a decrease in the activity of the saturating gas atmosphere, which is achieved by diluting nitrogen with an inert gas. Experimental studies are carried out on 1.5-mm-thick sheet samples of Kh18N10T austenitic steel with a standard (0.5% Ti) and increased (1.0% Ti) titanium content. Experiments are performed in a laboratory facility for high-temperature nitriding (900–1200°C), and pure nitrogen and nitrogen and argon mixtures are used as saturating media. Two-stage processes consisting of nitriding in nitrogen followed by annealing in argon are also studied. Metallographic analysis has shown that, at the same nitriding temperature, the amount of chromium nitrides decreases in experimental steel with increasing titanium content and nitrogen dilution with argon decreases the temperature of chromium nitride precipitation. When studying the saturation kinetics, we determine the through nitriding time of a sheet sample under various saturation conditions and calculate the denitriding annealing time using the determined chromium nitride zone thicknesses. The precipitation hardening of internal nitriding zones with titanium nitrides is found to increase the strength characteristics of steels both at room and at elevated temperatures compared to the characteristics of 08Kh18N10T base steel after typical heat treatment, and the maximum hardening effect is achieved upon through nitriding of steel with 1.0% Ti. The versions recommended for through nitriding of a 1.5-mm-thick experimental steel sheet are as follows:tnit= 1050°C, N2, 16 h;tnit= 1100°C, 50% N2+ 50% Ar, 22 h; andtnit= 1100°C, N2, 5 h +tann= 1200°C, Ar, 9 h. The ultimate tensile strength of nitrided steel increases by 45–50% at room temperature and by 40–65% at 800°C depending on the process conditions. Through nitriding makes it possible to increase the operating temperature of steels by 100–150°C while ensuring the same long-term strength. The heat resistance at 900°C is retained at the level of non-nitrided steel after two-stage processes, which ensure the maximum removal of chromium nitrides from the surface at the annealing stage.",Materials Science,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1134/S0036029525700582,2

Drawing on the 1,883,593 granted patents in pharmaceuticals and their 1,546,960 cited papers prior to 2018, we found patents with scientific references appear to be more disruptive than those without scientific citations and such effect has gradually pronounced in recent decades, even though technological disruptiveness is generally declining over time. For each granted patent, we further developed three scientific characteristics including science intensity, science novelty and science recency and estimated their effects on technological disruptiveness. The regression analysis showed science intensity and science novelty both have an inverted U-shaped relationship with technological disruptiveness, suggesting intermediate-level novel scientific knowledge input can inspire the generation of disruptive ideas for pharmaceutical technological innovation. While science recency presents a negative association, underlying that recent scientific knowledge could offer advanced theoretical insights that may destabilize the existing technological trajectory. Moreover, collaboration is another important factor in enhancing the disruptive impact of science on technology. Our study contributes to the existing literature by introducing the disruptive impact of science on technology.",Materials Science,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11192-024-05126-9,2
"Informal learning environments are increasingly recognized as transformative spaces for enriching science education through experiential, real-world learning. This study investigated middle school science teachers’ perceptions and experiences of teaching in informal learning contexts in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. A qualitative multiple-case study design was employed with 14 teachers (Grades 7–9). Data were collected via semi-structured interviews, written reflective activities, and a focus group discussion, and analyzed thematically using the Curricular Spider Web model as an analytic lens. Findings reveal that while teachers value informal settings for boosting student engagement, curiosity, and understanding, they face significant challenges, notably resource shortages, financial constraints, and curriculum pressures, that hinder effective implementation. Teachers demonstrated resilience and adaptability by improvising with local materials and flexible strategies, though concerns about classroom management and limited training often tempered their use of playful, exploratory learning. The study highlights the need for targeted teacher education and policy support to address systemic barriers and better integrate informal learning opportunities into the curriculum. By utilizing informal environments and supporting teachers, stakeholders can enhance science teaching relevancy and equity, ultimately enriching students’ science learning experiences.",Materials Science,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s43545-025-01144-3,2

"The history of science (HOS) has played an important role in science curricula for teaching about science. However, historical information in science textbooks is often de-contextualized, coupled with limited class time and teaching barriers, and thus fails to help students understand the dynamic process of scientific development. This research effort was then directed to design nontextbook, supplemental reading materials that include scientific historical vignettes and guiding questions to elicit views about nature of science (NOS). The homework notebook was designed as a carrier to provide students after-school learning opportunities with the HOS-NOS approach. In the large-scale implementation study, 18 middle school homeroom teachers voluntarily adopted the designed HOS-based notebook for the regular purpose of homework recording and teacher-parent communication over a semester. They were interviewed about homework policies. Their students’ scientific epistemological beliefs and individual interests in science and reading were assessed at the beginning and end of the semester to evaluate the effectiveness of the notebook. Quantitative results indicated that these 7th and 8th grade students had significant improvements in epistemic understandings of the source and the (un)certainty of scientific knowledge after using this notebook. Students’ individual interest in science and reading was interrelated with their epistemic views about the evolving nature of science and justification methods in science. Further explorations on the quality of students’ reflective writings in the notebook suggested that students’ reading experiences were affected by the homework policies and writing requirements their homeroom teachers adopted. This research provides implications on the design of reading materials for improving students’ scientific literacy.",Materials Science,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10763-022-10285-3,2
"AbstractComputational methods and machine learning (ML) are reshaping materials science by accelerating their discovery, design, and optimization. Traditional approaches such as density functional theory and molecular dynamics have been instrumental in studying materials at the atomic level. However, their high computational cost and, in certain cases, limited accuracy can restrict the scope ofin silicoexploration. ML promises to accelerate material property prediction and design. However, in many areas, the volume and fidelity of the data are critical barriers. Active learning can reduce the reliance on large data sets, and simulation has emerged as a critical tool for generating data on the fly. Despite these advances, challenges remain, particularly in data quality, model interpretability, and bridging the gap between computational predictions and experimental validation. Future research should develop automated frameworks capable of designing and testing materials for specific applications, and integrating ML with traditional simulations and experiments can contribute to this goal.Graphic abstractA schematic diagram illustrates the evolution of computational materials science, from early density functional theory (DFT) and molecular dynamics (MD) methods to the integration of high-throughput simulations and machine learning (ML).

"Medical sciences education emphasizes basic science learning as a prerequisite to clinical learning. Studies exploring relationships between achievement in the basic sciences and subsequent achievement in the clinical sciences generally suggest a significant positive relationship. Basic science knowledge and clinical experience are theorized to combine to form encapsulated knowledge– a dynamic mix of information that is useful for solving clinical problems. This study explores the relationship between basic science knowledge (BSK), clinical science knowledge (CSK), and clinical problem-solving ability, as measured within the context of four veterinary colleges using both college-specific measures and professionally validated, standardized measures of basic and clinical science knowledge and problem-solving ability. Significant correlations existed among all variables. Structural equation modeling and confirmatory factor analysis were used to produce models showing that newly acquired BSK directly and significantly predicted BSK retained over time and newly acquired CSK, as well as indirectly predicted clinical problem-solving ability (mediated by newly acquired CSK and BSK retained over time). These findings likely suggest a gradual development of schema (encapsulated knowledge) and not an isolated development of biomedical versus clinical knowledge over time. A broader implication of these results is that explicitly teaching basic science knowledge positively and durably affects subsequent clinical knowledge and problem-solving ability independent of instructional strategy or curricular approach. Furthermore, for veterinary colleges specifically, student performance as measured by both course-level and standardized tests are likely to prove useful for predicting subsequent academic achievement in classroom and clinical settings, licensing examination performance, and/or for identifying students likely in need of remediation in clinical knowledge.",Materials Science,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10459-024-10334-2,2
"REINFORCE (Research Infrastructures FOR Citizens in Europe) is a Research & Innovation Project, supported by the European Union’s Horizon 2020 SwafS, ‘Science with and for Society’ work programme (GA872859). The project, which ran from December, 2019, to November, 2022, engaged the public in a variety of innovative ways. Four citizen-science demonstrator projects were developed on the world-leading Zooniverse platform, each focussing on a different area of frontier physics: gravitational waves; neutrino astronomy; particle physics; and muography. A range of art and science events were launched and undertaken. A data-sonification tool—sonoUno—was developed in order to improve the accessibility of the data used in the four demonstrator projects. A course on critical thinking and a history of the Second Scientific Revolution was provided on YouTube and in podcast form, while a senior-citizen-science course was designed, co-developed and implemented. These initiatives were supported by a detailed engagement plan, a dedicated communications and dissemination strategy, and a constantly evolving assessment and evaluation approach. The experiences garnered during the project, in conjunction with consultations with project participants, volunteers and stakeholders, were built into the form of a policy roadmap explaining how to integrate citizen science into research infrastructures in Europe. The roadmap identifies a series of policy objectives and related policy gaps, associated challenges and lays out a series of recommendations.

"BackgroundPragmatism is important in implementation science to ensure that implementation methods reflect the practical concerns of the stakeholders and services involved in change. To evaluate the usability of these methods, pragmatic measures have been developed using psychometrics. However, existing approaches have predominantly inherited a definition of pragmatism from the evidence-based healthcare movement. These metrics may not reflect concerns with pragmatism that public stakeholders (defined as those with expertise by experience of healthcare systems) may have with implementation science.AimsConsequently, our aim was to carry out participatory research to explore stakeholder views of pragmatic measures in implementation science theory.MethodsWe convened a working group of eight stakeholders. To facilitate discussion, we created educational materials, including a video and flyer. The working group conducted three meetings, engaging in abductive analysis to investigate the presented issues.ResultsStakeholders expressed concerns about the restricted definition of pragmatism, the potential for biases in measurement, and the necessity for a holistic, pluralistic approach that incorporates diverse perspectives when developing and evaluating implementation theory and metrics. These findings underscore the risk of distorting the development of implementation science methods without the input and scrutiny of stakeholders. Neglecting the wider application of pragmatic philosophy in implementation science could limit stakeholder involvement in the design of implementation methods and service transformation.ConclusionsThis study, guided by experts with lived experience in healthcare services, opens doors for considering pragmatic philosophy in the evolution of pragmatic implementation measures and metrics, offering numerous promising directions for further exploration.",Materials Science,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s43058-025-00730-z,2
"BackgroundSTEM education has experienced significant growth due to its pivotal role in innovation and economic development. While cognitive factors like prior knowledge are known predictors of STEM success, non-cognitive factors, including attitudes and demographics, also play vital roles. However, there is a notable scarcity of research focusing on the ""S"" in STEM—science—compared to extensive studies in fields like mathematics. This study aims to address this gap by exploring gender differences in science test performance and related attitudes, providing insights into this under-researched aspect of STEM education.ResultsThe effective sample comprised 1839 Estonian 12th-grade students who took a computer-assisted science test. The test consisted of tasks combining chemistry, physics, biology, and geography, and a post-test survey was also administered. Across the total sample, the results showed that test performance positively correlated with test-taking duration, effort, and test importance. Test performance was negatively correlated with perceived test difficulty. Interestingly, while general science anxiety was not associated with test performance, subject-specific anxiety, especially chemistry anxiety had a negative association with test performance. While there were no gender differences in test performance, female students scored consistently higher on all science anxiety measures, compared to male students. Furthermore, female students assessed the science test to be more difficult, and they also took more time to complete the test. The correlations in gender subsamples mirrored those observed in the total sample.ConclusionsThe association between science test performance and test-related variables is nuanced: students might not necessarily have a “general” STEM anxiety but it may be associated with a specific subject. Moreover, the findings imply that although there are no gender differences in test performance, girls have a greater anxiety when it comes to natural sciences subjects. These findings indicate the need for investigating the origin of such anxieties, which do not seem to stem from aptitude.",Materials Science,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40594-024-00504-4,2
"Art and Science are often perceived as distant domains. In addition, as knowledge becomes increasingly specific, the lack of communication among Art and Science practitioners can intensify. As a result, the division (or fragmentation) of these fields limits a holistic understanding of themselves and the deep historical connection between them. On the other hand, when artists and scientists collaborate, they produce richer interpretations of reality. The present theoretical paper delves into the existing relationship between Art and Science as diverse but converging paths of understanding the complexity of the world and our place in it. In embracing this perspective, education emerges as a critical bridge to overcome dichotomous perceptions of knowledge production processes, especially in teacher education programs. Science education can benefit not only from the technical aspects of Art, but also from its philosophical and conceptual understanding, contributing to a more humane, creative, and comprehensive view of the natural world.",Materials Science,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11191-024-00580-6,2
"Materials with large spin–orbit torque (SOT) hold considerable significance for many spintronic applications because of their potential for energy-efficient magnetization switching. Unfortunately, most of the existing materials exhibit an SOT efficiency factor that is much less than unity, requiring a large current for magnetization switching. The search for new materials that can exhibit an SOT efficiency much greater than unity is a topic of active research, and only a few such materials have been identified using conventional approaches. In this paper, we present a machine learning-based approach using a word embedding model that can identify new results by deciphering non-trivial correlations among various items in a specialized scientific text corpus. We show that such a model can be used to identify materials likely to exhibit high SOT and rank them according to their expected SOT strengths. The model captured the essential spintronics knowledge embedded in scientific abstracts within various materials science, physics, and engineering journals and identified 97 new materials to exhibit high SOT. Among them, 16 candidate materials are expected to exhibit an SOT efficiency greater than unity, and one of them has recently been confirmed with experiments with quantitative agreement with the model prediction.",Materials Science,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1038/s41524-025-01626-1,2
"This study examined parents’ beliefs and potential links with their children’s (1) interest in science, (2) competence in learning science, and (3) science learning opportunities offered to their children. The study included a sample of 1,490 parents who had young children enrolled in U.S. preschool (3 years old, 55.9%) and pre-kindergarten (4 years old, 44.1%) classes. Data were collected via online surveys, which included three components: Perceived Science Motivation for Children-Parents Form, Parental Expectation and Support for Learning Science Questionnaire, and socio-demographic questions about parents and their children. Based on rankings of science and other curricular areas, parents’ responses were classified into three groups: Low, Moderate, and High Preference for Science. Few parents prioritized science over other curricular areas in early learning classrooms, and parents’ preferences for science were not associated with their incomes, levels of education, or the children’s ages or sex. Parents’ gender, however, was related to their preferences for science. Their beliefs about children’s interest in science and competence to learn science were associated with home science resources, science-related conversations, and parental preferences for learning science in early childhood classrooms. Results from this study suggest that parents’ beliefs about children’s interest in science and competence to learn science predict the science learning opportunities provided to their children.",Materials Science,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10643-025-01888-w,2

"Pre-service teacher (PST) training is an ideal time to introduce a practical heuristic for thinking critically about science instruction. The construct of epistemic reflexivity or how views of knowledge and ways of knowing lead to practical application, offers a pathway to improve science teaching in the elementary classroom. Nature of scientific knowledge (NOSK) provides a set of vocabulary that reflects foundational truths about the field, while epistemic reflexivity fosters PSTs critical engagement with these constructs and supports their application in teaching. Recent advances in epistemic education, a field that supports epistemic growth, emphasizes engaging teachers in the critical evaluation of knowledge that leads to action. To date, no studies have documented preservice teachers’ use of the (3R–EC) framework (Reflection, Reflexivity, and Resolved Action - Epistemic Cognition) as developed by Lunn Brownlee and colleagues (2017/19) to support epistemic reflexivity. This paper reports the results of a pilot study in a baccalaureate-level teacher induction program where candidates engaged in reflexivity to examine how expert knowledge in science might influence classroom teaching. A written assessment structured around prompts aligned to the (3R–EC) framework was used. After reading scenarios that illustrated the tentative nature of knowledge, candidates answered questions designed to explore (1) the ways they engaged in reflexivity for teaching elementary science using (3R–EC) and (2) the extent to which reflexivity supported their cognition about science instruction. Findings offer a baseline for how epistemic reflexivity enabled candidates to articulate both epistemic (e.g., develop knowledge) and non-epistemic (e.g., develop social skills) aims. Illustrative cases show that while NOSK was widely acknowledged as uncertain, it was enacted in a variety of ways from emphasizing trusted sources to enhancing process skills. Preliminary findings suggest implications for transforming teacher training programs through efforts to make explicit the dual aims of teacher development, balancing epistemic aims (knowledge focused) with non-epistemic aims (social/practical) in science education.",Materials Science,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s43031-025-00129-9,2

"The Structural Genomics Consortium is an international open science research organization with a focus on accelerating early-stage drug discovery, namely hit discovery and optimization. We, as many others, believe that artificial intelligence (AI) is poised to be a main accelerator in the field. The question is then how to best benefit from recent advances in AI and how to generate, format and disseminate data to enable future breakthroughs in AI-guided drug discovery. We present here the recommendations of a working group composed of experts from both the public and private sectors. Robust data management requires precise ontologies and standardized vocabulary while a centralized database architecture across laboratories facilitates data integration into high-value datasets. Lab automation and opening electronic lab notebooks to data mining push the boundaries of data sharing and data modeling. Important considerations for building robust machine-learning models include transparent and reproducible data processing, choosing the most relevant data representation, defining the right training and test sets, and estimating prediction uncertainty. Beyond data-sharing, cloud-based computing can be harnessed to build and disseminate machine-learning models. Important vectors of acceleration for hit and chemical probe discovery will be (1) the real-time integration of experimental data generation and modeling workflows within design-make-test-analyze (DMTA) cycles openly, and at scale and (2) the adoption of a mindset where data scientists and experimentalists work as a unified team, and where data science is incorporated into the experimental design.",Materials Science,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1038/s41467-024-49777-x,2
"AbstractThis work demonstrates the viability of using a plasma-focused ion beam (PFIB) as a new platform to carry out radiation effects studies in solids. While materials subjected to irradiation in either nuclear reactors or energetic particle accelerators experience limitations with respect to inaccuracies in both flux measurements and lack of precise control of irradiation areas, we demonstrate a new irradiation technique that allows the exposure of a single specimen in multiple areas, at multiple doses, and in site-specific dependencies - all with flux variations on the order of only 1%. This versatile technique also allows materials to be exposed to significantly higher irradiation dose rates than conventional accelerators. To validate the new methodology, we selected the classical example of ion-beam-induced amorphization of pure single-crystal Si. By pioneering the use of the PFIB for radiation effects studies in materials science, we were able to exploit, in both micro- and nanometer-sized detail, the differences in electron image contrast arising from crystalline versus amorphous solid-state phases in classical semiconductors subjected to irradiation, thus providing new insights on amorphization mechanisms. This methodology opens new research frontiers at the fringe of materials science with promising applications beyond the scope of materials at extremes such as in nanopatterning, nanodevices and nanoarchitectonics.Graphical Abstract",Materials Science,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10853-022-07667-x,2
"Transparency and openness are frequently praised as vital institutional strategies to foster public trust in science. The expectation is that transparent and open science will be more trusted, either because publics will have access to information about what scientists do or because scientists will behave better under the watchful gaze of others. In this contribution, we challenge this widespread assumption by searching for the downsides of transparency in relation to public trust in science. The question we ask is: could transparency also have unintended negative effects on public trust? First, we considertheoreticaltreatments of transparency that challenge its status as an absolute value. This analysis highlights the benefits of seclusion and secrecy and the perils of excessive transparency. Next, we turn to thepracticeof transparency, as enacted via open-science strategies. Open Science is a framework defined by a commitment to openness, sharing and collaboration; effectively, it offers a set of actionable strategies for scientists to be transparent. We examine risks associated with both specific open-science strategies and an Open Science normativity. This allows us to explicate three concrete pathways via which the enactment of transparency could inadvertently harm public trust in science. These pathways indicate that transparency (as enacted via open-science strategies) could fuel 1) well-placed distrust, 2) misplaced trust or 3) misplaced distrust. Eventually, we conclude that the architecture of Open Science needs a conditional and contextual operationalisation of transparency which results in new responsibilities for the scientific community.",Materials Science,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11569-025-00481-0,2

"Textbooks have several important functions in science education. By interviewing six teachers, this study shows how secondary school science teachers perceive and use textbooks as resources, especially in inquiry teaching. The results show that textbooks aid inquiry teaching by offering teachers easily accessible suggestions for practical and inquiry activities in accordance with the curriculum to be implemented in science lessons in addition to presenting scientific content adapted to students’ level in which they can use to easily link theory to their practical inquiry. However, the use of textbook inquiry activities can restrict the degrees of freedom in implementing inquiries, as textbooks are perceived to rarely include inquiry activities with many degrees of freedom. In addition, some teachers adjust their textbook inquiry activities to have fewer degrees of freedom to meet the challenges they experience, such as time pressure and uncertainty about students achieving curriculum content knowledge goals. These results build important knowledge about textbooks’ role in planning and implementing inquiry teaching in science. They should be of interest to teacher education programme developers and textbook authors who desire to contribute to a more inquiry-oriented practice in school science teaching.",Materials Science,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11191-023-00492-x,2
"This study examined the effect of design-based science instruction (DBSI) on sixth grade students’ science achievement, as well as their development in relation to science process skills. 213 sixth grade students from three public schools participated in the study.

While the experimental group was taught through the DBSI method, the control group was taught in accordance with the inquiry-based curriculum-oriented science instruction. Mixed between-within subjects ANOVA showed that at the end of the treatment, the mean scores of the experimental group concerning all dependent variables were found statistically higher than those of the control group. The achievement scores of both groups increased over time; however, the effect size values indicated that the increase in the achievement scores in the experimental group was greater than that in the control group. Regarding the science process skills, while scores of the students in the experimental group increased over time, no significant change occurred in the control group. The results showed that the DBSI exerts a positive influence on middle school students related to their science achievement and science process skills.

"This study investigates how English academic proficiency, entry qualifications as measured by students’ prior academic scores at 8th grade, parental involvement, and math achievement are associated with high school science achievement among ESL students. Using a path analysis model, data were analyzed from 570 graduating seniors in rural high schools in Kenya. The results revealed that English academic proficiency and parental involvement had the strongest direct effects on science achievement. Math Achievement was an important intervening variable in the associations between the other three predictors and Science Achievement.The findings underscore the importance of English academic proficiency and parental involvement for non-native speakers in STEM learning. Unlike native speakers who already possess fluency in the language of instruction, ESL learners face the added challenge of developing academic language skills while also learning subject-specific content. This dual burden can significantly affect their academic performance, highlighting the need for targeted interventions to support ESL students in STEM education. These findings could inform educational policies and practices that integrate language support into STEM instruction, actively engage families, and strengthen foundational math skills to provide data-driven academic support services.",Materials Science,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s41979-025-00161-4,2

"The objective of this descriptive study is to provide a detailed examination of science teachers’ perspectives regarding scientific knowledge, science learning, science concepts, and science teaching. A total of 304 science teachers created metaphors to express their cognitions about the epistemological aspects of their work. A specifically designed metaphor construction task was used to capture the participants’ epistemic cognitions. The participants’ metaphorical reasoning was captured since the metaphors might deliver experience-based conceptions, perceptions, beliefs, or comprehensions about four concepts regarding epistemic cognition. In-depth, descriptive analysis was undertaken through open, axial, and selective coding procedures with higher validity and reliability. The participants’ epistemic cognitions were gathered around five-order themes: function (accepting science knowledge and science concepts and their teaching/learning as vital entities by adopting an instrumentalist or tool-based perspective), personal epistemological stance (seeing science knowledge and science learning as an endless and immortal accumulation of factual knowledge), motivational construct (scientific knowledge attaches importance so it should be taught in the school systems in the science lessons), sociological construct (science knowledge provides power), and pedagogical construct (not the science knowledge but the science concepts should be taught in the schools in the science lesson). This study concluded that the participant science teachers mostly held conventional orientations in externalizing their epistemic cognitions. Theory-based explanations are presented in terms of the participants’ traditional epistemic orientations in the sense of future directions of further research.",Materials Science,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11191-023-00494-9,2

"The philosophy of science (POS) has gained recognition for its contributions to science education, particularly in integrating the history and philosophy of science (HPS). However, the existing literature lacks a comprehensive review that systematically investigates the implications and limitations of POS in science education research. This study conducted a systematic literature review of 54 studies published in internationally reputed journals between 2000 and 2021. The aim is to understand the implications and limitations of integrating POS into science education. The findings revealed that POS has a significant positive impact on science education, specifically in enhancing conceptual understanding and knowledge of the nature of science (NOS). It went beyond singular epistemological influences and changed teachers’ beliefs about teaching methods. However, implementing POS in science education faced challenges such as unclear teaching objectives, a lack of POS perspective in textbooks, curriculum constraints, and insufficient specialized training for teachers. The study offers a comprehensive review of the contributions of POS to science education, filling a gap in the existing literature. It highlights the positive impacts and critically examines the limitations and challenges, providing a balanced view for future research and practice.",Materials Science,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11191-023-00485-w,2
"This paper presents an analysis of three teachers’ “ordinary” class sessions integrating historical elements of science in their teaching: one a teacher of physics and chemistry and two teachers of biology and geology. It explores what prompts these teachers to integrate the history of science into their lessons, the functions they attribute to such history, the degree to which historical and scientific elements are interwoven into the tasks proposed to the students, and the types of knowledge these tasks aim to develop among students. To categorize a typology of the different knowledge areas targeted in science classes, we designed a framework of historical epistemology in order to parameterize a common scenario using the lexical analysis tool Tropes, which was then implemented to analyze the teachers’ discourse during their class sessions. To study their ordinary practices, we adopted a double didactic and ergonomic framework approach. The analyses present the contrasting practices employed by three teachers in integrating historical aspects and identify logics of action specific to each teacher. For one of the teachers, the logic of action was shaped by the institutional framework, addressing the prescribed epistemological focus. For the other two teachers, the logic of action was induced by both the current socio-cultural issues and their own social commitment. The purpose of this study was to test general tools for analyzing teaching practices. Our methodology of knowledge categorization appears robust for the purpose of analyzing ordinary practices in integrating the history of science in science classroom sessions.",Materials Science,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11191-024-00501-7,2
"Over the last few years, the study of adaptable light-driven actuators based on two-dimensional materials has risen to prominence as a pioneering research domain in the field of materials science and engineering. Graphene, transition metal disulfides (TMDs), MXene, and similar two-dimensional materials have shown considerable promise in the realms of nanotechnology and pliable electronics. This is attributed to their ultra-thin atomic layers, expansive specific surface areas, and exceptional electrical and optical characteristics. When these materials are integrated into flexible actuators, they can deform or move by absorbing light of a specific wavelength to change their physical state. Such actuators have shown great application prospects in many fields. At present, there are no review papers on the application of photothermal effects to optical drivers in 2D materials. This article offers a comprehensive review of the characteristics and optical properties of various two-dimensional substances. It delves into the photothermal effects of these materials in a range of sectors, highlighting their targeted deployment in the realm of optical actuation technology.

"Urban science is an emerging and transdisciplinary field that attracts deep interest in planning degree programs from educational institutions worldwide. Urban science education emphasizes the science of cities and urban information technology by integrating design, engineering, system science, spatial science, behavioral and social science, decision science, and other disciplines. The increasing complexity of urban systems creates significant pedagogical challenges for urban science education, particularly in problem structuring, which is the process of structuring, or defining, (a) the scope of the problem, (b) the potential ways for addressing the problem, and (c) suitable criteria for judging solutions to the problem. In this article, we describe the theoretical foundations of problem structuring in relation to urban science education and explain why it is difficult to teach. In response to this pedagogical challenge, we propose DIMES (Describe, Inquire, Model, Extract, and State), a novel domain-agnostic method combining design thinking and systems thinking developed for problem structuring in any level of higher education. We describe how the DIMES method can be integrated into urban science curricula with relation to critical considerations for teaching urban science problem structuring, the fast-evolving smart city development, and the disruptive impact of generative artificial intelligence on urban science education. Finally, we provide our thoughts on potential future studies with DIMES in urban science learning settings.",Materials Science,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s44243-025-00064-3,2
"Applied machine learning has rapidly spread throughout the physical sciences. In fact, machine learning-based data analysis and experimental decision-making have become commonplace. Here, we reflect on the ongoing shift in the conversation from proving that machine learning can be used, to how to effectively implement it for advancing materials science. In particular, we advocate a shift from a big data and large-scale computations mentality to a model-oriented approach that prioritizes the use of machine learning to support the ecosystem of computational models and experimental measurements. We also recommend an open conversation about dataset bias to stabilize productive research through careful model interrogation and deliberate exploitation of known biases. Further, we encourage the community to develop machine learning methods that connect experiments with theoretical models to increase scientific understanding rather than incrementally optimizing materials. Moreover, we envision a future of radical materials innovations enabled by computational creativity tools combined with online visualization and analysis tools that support active outside-the-box thinking within the scientific knowledge feedback loop.",Materials Science,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1038/s43246-022-00283-x,2
"Murmurings of teachers and students are typical to hear outside of classrooms at Gayaza High School in Kampala, Uganda, but today these sounds of learning and discourse are accompanied by something else: gasps of wonder. On this day, students at Gayaza High School, the oldest all-girls boarding secondary school in Uganda, are taking their education into their own hands. The supplies, one blown-up balloon and one empty aluminum can, are simple enough. The girls rub the balloons on their hair and bring them close to the cans that are placed on their sides. As the cans begin rolling toward the balloons, smiles break out on the girls’ faces. Experimenting with static electricity charges the room with excitement. John Bakayana, physics and mathematics teacher at Gayaza High School, remarking on the girls’ reactions, says, “It seemed amazing how force due to the charge obtained using friction by rubbing with hair could make the can move.” Promoting enthusiasm for and building capacity in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) subjects is precisely what Women Supporting Women in the Sciences (WS2) had in mind when it started more than five years ago.Secondary level students in Nyamsenda, Kenya, rolling metal cans with static electricity.

"The main purpose of the present study was to investigate the historical content in high school science textbooks in Iran to determine what image of scientists is drawn in them. For this purpose, first, the content related to the history of science in 16 science textbooks was coded as initial data. Then, a thematic network analysis was used to interpret the resulting data. Based on this method, 12 basic themes and 3 organizing categories, namely, “general biography,” “scientific biography,” and “role in the evolution of science,” were revealed. These organizing themes were also interpreted as one global theme of the “biographical portrayal of scientists.” Only 5 female scientists (of 113 total) are mentioned in science textbooks, which suggests the presence of gender stereotyping. Also, in addition to Western scientists (mostly European or North American), the high school science textbooks in Iran paid special attention to scientists of Iranian-Islamic nationality. The characteristics of scientists’ families and their individual and personality traits were the extracted themes that were revealed as the social and cultural aspects of the nature of science in the historical content of textbooks. The basic themes of scientists’ quotes, scientific books and treatises, used methods of scientific research, being named in honor of the scientist, and winning the Nobel Prize were recognized as scientific biography. Scientists’ role in the evolution of science was the third organizing category, which comprised the scientists’ scientific research area and their outstanding work for the first time. In the end, the implications for science education are discussed.",Materials Science,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11191-024-00522-2,2
"The sol-gel method has shown immense potential in materials science and nanotechnology. One of the cornerstone applications of the sol-gel technique includes the fabrication of inorganic glasses and glass-ceramics at relatively low temperatures as an alternative to conventional high-temperature melt-quench techniques. In recent times, glass fabrication with the sol-gel method has extended to additive manufacturing (AM), also referred to as 3D printing. Current sol-gel, glass AM uses solution-based gel compositions to produce three-dimensional glasses through layer-by-layer deposition and/or using photocurable polymer resins. Owing to its significant advantages of being able to fabricate glass components with arbitrary and complex geometry, AM presents a tantalizing opportunity to fabricate functionalized glass materials, increasing the technique’s popularity over the past decade.

"Synthetic polymers are indispensable as shell materials in microencapsulated phase change materials (MEPCMs), providing essential protection to the PCM core and ensuring thermal and chemical stability. This review highlights that polymers such as melamine-formaldehyde, polyurethane, and polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) are particularly advantageous due to their superior mechanical flexibility, high encapsulation efficiency, and broad compatibility with diverse PCMs. Advanced encapsulation techniques, like in-situ and interfacial polymerization, enable precise control over shell morphology and characteristics, facilitating the development of MEPCMs with tailored properties for applications in temperature-regulating building materials, durable asphalt pavements, thermal protection for electronics, and renewable energy storage. A critical analysis of recent studies reveals significant progress in enhancing the thermal reliability and energy storage capacity of these polymer-shell MEPCMs. However, key research gaps persist, particularly in reconciling the often competing demands of high thermal conductivity and robust mechanical strength, preventing PCM leakage over repeated thermal cycles, and mitigating the environmental concerns associated with certain polymer precursors. Future research avenues should prioritize the development of nano-enhanced polymer composites to improve thermal performance, alongside the pursuit of more sustainable and environmentally friendly encapsulation strategies. Addressing these challenges is crucial for unlocking the full potential of MEPCMs in next-generation thermal energy management systems.Graphical Abstract",Materials Science,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10965-025-04612-9,2
"Broad-absorbing materials, characterized by their tunable absorption across the ultraviolet to mid-infrared spectral regions, have emerged as a crucial class of optoelectronic materials. Significant advances have been achieved in organic and inorganic materials; however, current enhancement strategies remain largely platform-specific and are not guided by a unified physical framework. To address this gap, this review introduces a three-factor physical model grounded in the theory of transition probability, thereby providing a consistent theoretical basis for understanding how electronic transitions are modulated across orbital, vibrational, and spin dimensions. Structure-mechanism-performance relationships are systematically examined in classic material platforms. In addition, the contributions of external-field enhancement mechanisms, such as plasmonic resonance, to spectral broadening and local-field enhancement are discussed. Based on clear mechanistic insight and targeted materials design, recent advances in integrating broad-absorbing materials into broadband photodetectors are highlighted, emphasizing their practical relevance. The review examines the three core challenges and mechanism-driven design strategies for high-performance broadband optoelectronic systems, providing an instructive outlook for future advancements.",Materials Science,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40843-025-3577-4,2
"A growing global trend emphasizes the integration of science education into early childhood curricula. This has led to the development and implementation of policies aimed at promoting the teaching of scientific inquiry skills. The attitudes and beliefs of early childhood educators significantly influence the successful adoption of these pedagogical innovations. The present study focused on fostering interest in science among underprivileged children belonging to government early childhood education centres in Telangana state, India. The research initiated with the development of seven science experiments, designing science kits for conducting these experiments, and training the teachers on how to conduct the experiments. The study involved a total of 60 children from both urban and rural areas of Telangana State, India. When teachers conducted the science experiments with children aged 4 to 6 years, videos were carefully recorded. Video analysis was done through the Behavioural Observation Research Interactive Software (BORIS). For each experiment, ethogram was set with different behaviour codes, selected children as focal subjects, and extracted the data from the software. The results revealed that children showed high levels of engagement in learning science experiments. They acquired basic science concepts and improved their vocabulary. Children not only gained hands-on experience but also nurtured intellectual curiosity and a scientific temper.

"Invisible gold research is essential for understanding gold mineralization, overcoming analytical limitations, and addressing the technological bottlenecks in the economic extraction of refractory gold, thereby unlocking the potential of these deposits and their tailings. To assess research trends and demand, this study analyzed 1300 records from the Web of Science database (1985–2024) using the cross-disciplinary publication index (CDPI), the co-authorship model, and the technology-economic linkage model (TELM), with visualizations generated via VOSviewer and Microsoft Excel. The analysis reveals a 65% increase in publications between 2015 and 2021, with a peak of 98 papers in 2021. Articles constitute the majority (84.6%), followed by conference proceedings (9.8%) and reviews (3.9%). Interdisciplinary contributions surged by 40% after 2015, particularly in “materials science”, as indicated by a high CDPI of 0.81; while a discipline-pair co-occurrence score between “materials science and nanotechnology” reached a CDPI of 0.75. Notably, the CDPI model reveals that 68% of advancements in extraction technologies between 2015 and 2024 originated from nanoscale-oriented invisible gold research published in geoscience-focused journals employing advanced nanotechnologies. Furthermore, the TELM framework identifies that between 2021 and 2024, high gold prices—ranging from $1,798/oz to $1,940/oz—were well correlated (R2= 0.89) with publication counts, which remained consistently high at 94 to 98 papers annually. Two key methodological trends identified in this study for invisible gold research are: (1) the development of environmentally friendly extraction techniques, including biooxidation or thiosulfate leaching, and advanced pre-treatment processes; and (2) the adoption of high-precision analytical tools such as LA-ICP-MS, SIMS, and TIMA-X, which have significantly enhanced nanoscale gold detection and characterization. This methodological progress is further supported by the increase in annual research funding—from approximately $2–5 million when gold prices averaged $370/oz (1985–2000), to $10–30 million at around $700/oz (2001–2015), and up to $50–120 million as prices exceeded $1,500/oz (2016–2024)—demonstrating a strong positive association between rising gold prices and investment in invisible gold research. The findings reveal key trends in invisible gold research, demonstrating that Web of Science data, VOSviewer visualizations, and the CDPI and TELM frameworks provide a more reliable basis for identifying interdisciplinary patterns and economic drivers. They highlight not only scientific progress in mineral exploration, extraction technologies, and metallurgical methods, but also persistent challenges in the economic recovery of invisible gold. These insights offer a roadmap for future research, industrial application, and international collaboration.",Materials Science,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12145-025-01982-y,2

"BackgroundThere has been increased attention to the need for, and the positive impact of, engaged or participatory science in recent years. Implementation scientists have an opportunity to leverage and contribute to engagement science (ES) through the systematic integration of engagement into implementation science (IS). The purpose of this study was to gather information from researchers and others to develop a prioritized list of research needs and opportunities at the intersection of IS and ES.MethodsWe conducted three Zoom-based focus groups with 20 researchers to generate a list of unmet needs, barriers, and to describe normative themes about use of ES and IS. Then a panel of nine experts in IS and/or engagement ranked the needs and barriers using a survey and met via a Zoom meeting to discuss and generate research opportunities and questions, with reference to the focus group outputs.ResultsRespondents and experts concurred on the importance of engagement in IS. Focus group participants reported 28 needs and barriers under the themes of 1) need for best practice guidance related to engagement processes and outcomes and 2) structural barriers to integrating ES in IS. The expert panel prioritized six structural barriers and four barriers related to generating best practice guidance, with corresponding recommendations on research opportunities. Example research opportunities related to engagement processes included: define “successful” engagement in IS contexts; adapt engagement tools and best practices from other disciplines into IS. Example research opportunities related to outcomes included: assess the impact of engagement on IS outcomes; examine engagement practices that lead to optimal engaged research. Example research opportunities related to structural barriers included: leverage research evidence to create structural changes needed to expand support for engaged IS; examine factors that influence institutional buy-in of engagement in IS.ConclusionsResearch needs exist that relate to engagement processes, outcomes, and structural barriers, even for scientists who value engaged research. Expert panelists recommended sequential and reinforcing research opportunities that implementation and engagement scientists can tackle together to advance both fields and health equity.

"While the socio-ecological challenges of the Anthropocene are complex and interdisciplinary in nature, contemporary science is profoundly implicated in understanding and responding to them. The latest Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) Programme for International Student Development (PISA) 2025 Science Framework has responded by expanding the scope of science education to prepare students for the decision-making and action-taking required of all citizens in the face of these contemporary challenges. Yet, mainstream science education has historically been dominated by a program of introducing students to the conceptual products and associated practices of science. In this manuscript we briefly trace the history of science-society-environment advocacy in science education to argue that the dimensions needed for this revitalisation are in many senses a natural extension of historical movements, but that some dimensions, particularly the need to develop decision-making skills and action focusing on developing student agency and calls for consideration of diverse ways of knowing and social justice framings, require a substantive extension of traditional practice. We explore the history of how agency has been framed in science education research, and apply theory and practice developed within the field of environmental education to explore ways forward for engaging students in the substantial agentic practices implied by the PISA Science Framework. In particular, we examine the construct of agency as a useful extension to earlier constructs attempting to capture critical action-oriented educational purposes. We draw on existing practices in both the science and environmental/climate change education literature to suggest classroom practices that represent this expanded vision of science education.",Materials Science,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11165-025-10276-8,2

"As nations advance toward achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly SDG 4 (Quality Education) and SDG 10 (Reduced Inequalities), equitable access to engaging science education is critical. However, the integration of digital assessment tools in basic science classrooms remains underexplored, particularly in relation to shaping student attitudes across diverse socioeconomic backgrounds. Grounded in the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), this study investigated the impact of technology-enabled assessments on students’ attitudes toward basic science, emphasizing their potential to foster sustainable science education. We employed a pretest–posttest quasi-experimental design involving 150 Junior Secondary School 2 (JSS2) students from six Nigerian schools. Participants were randomly assigned to one of three instructional groups: traditional textbook learning (control), technology-enabled assessment with feedback only (TEAPF), and with both feedback and remediation (TEAPFR). Attitudinal and socioeconomic data were collected using validated instruments and analyzed using ANCOVA. Our results revealed that both TEAPF and TEAPFR groups exhibited significantly more positive attitudes towards basic science than the control group. Notably, students’ socioeconomic background showed no significant effect, nor did it interact with the assessment type. These findings underscore the inclusivity and effectiveness of feedback-rich, technology-supported assessment models in promoting positive learner dispositions, independent of socioeconomic context. We conclude that TEAPs have the potential to enhance student engagement, reduce disparities in participation, and support reflective, learner-centered pedagogy. We recommend increased investment in offline-compatible digital infrastructure, teacher capacity development, and policy support for embedding inclusive technology into science education practice.",Materials Science,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s43621-025-01963-7,2

"Transplanted cells can act as living drug factories capable of secreting therapeutic proteinsin vivo, with applications in the treatment of Type 1 diabetes (T1D), blood borne disease, vision disorders, and degenerative neural disease, potentially representing functional cures for chronic conditions. However, attack from the host immune system represents a major challenge, requiring chronic immunosuppression to enable long-lived cell transplantationin vivo. Encapsulating cells in engineered biomaterials capable of excluding components of the host immune system while allowing for the transport of therapeutic proteins, oxygen, nutrients, metabolites, and waste products represents a potential solution. However, the foreign-body response can lead to isolation from native vasculature and hypoxia leading to cell death. In this prospective article, we highlight materials-based solutions to three important challenges in the field: (i) improving biocompatibility and reducing fibrosis; (ii) enhancing transport of secreted protein drugs and key nutrients and oxygenviaengineered, semipermeable membranes; and (iii) improving oxygenation. These efforts draw on several disciplines in materials’ research, including polymer science, surfaces, membranes, biomaterials’ microfabrication, and flexible electronics.

"The study examined preservice teachers’ development in conceptions of NOS and their argumentation components using an explicit approach that targets NOS and argumentation. Participants were 20 preservice elementary teachers enrolled in a science methods course emphasizing explicit instruction of NOS and argumentation through various hands-on activities covering scientific and socioscientific contexts. Data were gathered through pre-/post context-specific questionnaires followed by semi-structured interviews. Results showed substantial improvements in participants’ conceptions of NOS and argumentation components. Notably, NOS comprehension showed a more pronounced enhancement in scientific contexts compared to socioscientific ones, while both contexts displayed developments in argumentation, slightly more so within scientific contexts. The results were interpreted taking into account the following issues: explicit approach for NOS and argumentation, connected approach to teach NOS and argumentation, and scientific vs. socioscientific contexts. Implications concerning NOS and argumentation pedagogy were discussed.",Materials Science,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11191-024-00498-z,2
"Recent advancements in shape memory materials (SMMs) and auxetic materials have created new opportunities for next-generation engineering applications. SMMs, including alloys, polymers, ceramics, and gels, can recover their original shape in response to external forces, enabling adaptive and self-healing systems. Auxetic materials with a negative Poisson’s ratio offer exceptional energy absorption, impact resistance, and mechanical tunability, making them ideal for aerospace, biomedical, and protective applications. Despite their advantages, the integration of these materials remains an emerging research frontier with significant potential for multifunctional material design. This review study provides a comparative analysis of recent progress in microstructure engineering, fabrication techniques, and performance optimization of auxetic materials, while also investigating the synergistic effects of combining SMMs and auxetic materials. It proposes future directions for industrial implementation and offers concrete insights to guide researchers in developing next-generation hybrid SMM-auxetic systems by addressing key challenges. This review research also bridges the gap between fundamental material science and practical applications, highlighting the transformative potential of these materials for advanced multifunctional structures in high-performance industries.",Materials Science,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s42247-025-01206-5,2
"Materials language processing (MLP) can facilitate materials science research by automating the extraction of structured data from research papers. Despite the existence of deep learning models for MLP tasks, there are ongoing practical issues associated with complex model architectures, extensive fine-tuning, and substantial human-labelled datasets. Here, we introduce the use of large language models, such as generative pretrained transformer (GPT), to replace the complex architectures of prior MLP models with strategic designs of prompt engineering. We find that in-context learning of GPT models with few or zero-shots can provide high performance text classification, named entity recognition and extractive question answering with limited datasets, demonstrated for various classes of materials. These generative models can also help identify incorrect annotated data. Our GPT-based approach can assist material scientists in solving knowledge-intensive MLP tasks, even if they lack relevant expertise, by offering MLP guidelines applicable to any materials science domain. In addition, the outcomes of GPT models are expected to reduce the workload of researchers, such as manual labelling, by producing an initial labelling set and verifying human-annotations.",Materials Science,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1038/s43246-024-00449-9,2
"Scientific machine learning (ML) aims to develop generalizable models, yet assessments of generalizability often rely on heuristics. Here, we demonstrate in the materials science setting that heuristic evaluations lead to biased conclusions of ML generalizability and benefits of neural scaling, through evaluations of out-of-distribution (OOD) tasks involving unseen chemistry or structural symmetries. Surprisingly, many tasks demonstrate good performance across models, including boosted trees. However, analysis of the materials representation space shows that most test data reside within regions well-covered by training data, while poorly-performing tasks involve data outside the training domain. For these challenging tasks, increasing training size or time yields limited or adverse effects, contrary to traditional neural scaling trends. Our findings highlight that most OOD tests reflect interpolation, not true extrapolation, leading to overestimations of generalizability and scaling benefits. This emphasizes the need for rigorously challenging OOD benchmarks.",Materials Science,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1038/s43246-024-00731-w,2

"Many disciplines utilize comics as educational resources in college courses, but this trend is less apparent in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields. Existing research on science comics often focuses on traditionally published comics; however, there is a growing number of examples of instructors and students self-publishing comics in the classroom. This paper reviews the theoretical educational benefits of comics as a medium, along with three unique approaches that STEM instructors can use to incorporate science comics into higher education courses. Practical approaches and assessment methods for implementing these three approaches are highlighted. While current research is limited, studies indicate that students enjoy using science comics as learning material and creating them for assignments. As researchers continue to investigate ways to improve science communication with the public, educators should consider how science comics can be utilized in college education to teach students the visual literacy and scholarly communication skills necessary for success in later careers.",Materials Science,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10755-025-09868-z,2

"Instructional practices in science education often create dichotomies of “expert” and “outsider” that produce distinct power differences in classrooms. Building upon the idea of “making present practice” to disrupt these binaries, this paper presents select findings from a year-long study investigating two urban teachers' use of community-based science (CBS) instructional practices to create relational shifts that reframe expert and expertise in science instruction. By examining how CBS instructional practices reframe power through co-learning experiences, our findings demonstrated that teachers positioned youth as knowledge constructors through three instructional practices: (a) creating space for students to share their knowledge and experiences, (b) positioning students’ lives and experiences as assets to/within science, and (c) being responsive to assets in future lessons. We use these findings to demonstrate how CBS instructional practices support shifts in relational dynamics by creating spaces of rightful presence, where students are viewed as legitimate classroom members who contribute scientific knowledge in practice and have power in the classroom space. By relinquishing traditional boundaries in science teaching to deconstruct ideas of who holds power, we position CBS instructional practices as a means to expand educational equity by legitimizing students’ diverse sensemaking and re-mediating hierarchical structures in classroom spaces.",Materials Science,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11422-023-10202-2,2
"Theatre Testing, a method extensively employed in marketing research and advertising, involves presenting materials to an audience in a controlled setting to gather feedback and insights. While the application of Theatre Testing in marketing and advertising is long-standing, its increasing application in prevention science raises several critical questions. This article describes the Theatre Testing process, debates the merits and drawbacks of the method, and exemplifies the pros and cons by discussing the method in relation to gender-based violence prevention within the Swedish ‘open preschool’ context. Advocates of Theatre Testing argue that simulating interventions before actual implementation offers valuable insights into participant responses, which can enhance the acceptability and effectiveness of these interventions. However, the controlled setting of Theatre Testing may not accurately reflect real-world conditions, leading to potentially misleading conclusions about the intervention. One promising development in addressing certain limitations, such as reaching the target group, is the introduction of social media-based Theatre Testing.",Materials Science,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10935-025-00832-3,2
"BackgroundImplementation science has a history of drawing from other fields to advance its science, yet understanding how approaches from marketing might enhance the field remains a largely untapped area of theoretical and methodological potential. Social marketing (i.e., applying commercial marketing to solve social or health problems) is a branch of marketing that shares many conceptual features with implementation science (e.g., behaviour change), but remains an unrealized opportunity for synergy. This review aimed to 1) describe studies that have tested social marketing interventions in controlled designs; 2) describe these interventions including their context, mechanism, and outcome; and 3) propose social marketing approaches that might be usefully applied to implementation science.MethodsThis scoping review, with a team consensus discussion, followed JBI (formerly the Joanna Briggs Institute) methodological guidance and included a team of researchers and practitioners in implementation, marketing, and social marketing. Twelve databases were searched. Studies were included that 1) utilized a randomized or non-randomized controlled intervention design; and 2) tested a social marketing intervention as defined by five essential social marketing criteria. Two reviewers independently completed all screening and extraction. Variables extracted included intervention details per social marketing criteria and the intervention’s context, mechanism, and outcome. Team consensus discussions of the scoping review results were used to determine approaches that might be usefully applied more broadly across implementation science.ResultsScreening of 4,867 citations yielded 28 included studies published from 1999–2023. All topics were from the health field and included nutrition (13, 46%), sexual health/family planning (6, 21%), physical activity (3, 11%), child safety (1, 4%), cancer screening (1, 4%), fall prevention (1, 4%), worksite safety (1, 4%), sanitation (1, 4%), and substance abuse (1, 4%). Novel theories identified included ‘Exchange Theory’ and ‘Consumer Information Processing Model’. Proposed approaches to consider for application included: leverage emotions; design for appeal; consider what your audience values; understand the price; understand the place; emphasize competitive advantage; and use branding.ConclusionsThis review examined the application of social marketing theories and approaches to implementation science.

"The integration of engineering practices into science education began to be explicitly promoted in the early twenty-first century and has since spread to many countries through recent curricular reforms. Despite this is fostered from the initial levels of education, there remains limited information on how to conduct it effectively in the classroom. To address this gap, a systematic review of studies published during the period 2001–2021 was conducted, focusing on the integration of engineering practices into primary education (6–12 years) science classes. A total of 24 studies were selected and analyzed to respond to how engineering practices are integrated into science classes, which engineering practices and science content are chosen, what challenges students are often faced with, and what evidence supports this curricular integration. The findings reveal that the predominant integration model is one that subordinates science to engineering learning using the project-based or design-based learning approach and teamwork. The most recurrent combination of engineering practices in the same learning situation is the one that includes “design solutions” and “obtaining, evaluating and/or communicating information,” while the use of computational thinking was not addressed in the studies analyzed. Regarding science content, studies suggest that virtually any topic can be useful to integrate engineering practices, normally aimed at designing or constructing artifacts. However, the evidence found on the educational benefits and feasibility of integrating engineering practices into primary science education shows a still inconclusive scenario. The study concludes with a discussion of its limitations and implications for future research and practice.",Materials Science,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11191-025-00616-5,2
"This study explored the impact of an extended explicit-reflective instruction through a triple blended learning environment (triple-BLE) on pre-service science teachers’ (PSTs) views of the nature of science (NOS). The triple-BLE included face-to-face (F2F), online, and out-of-school time (OST) engagement over two semesters. The study employed a pre-, mid-, and post-test design with random assignment. Seventy PSTs (33 males, 37 females) were randomly assigned to the treatment (N = 34) and control group (N = 36). While F2F and OST learning environments were common for both groups, the treatment group experienced a triple-BLE which integrated online learning into F2F and OST learning environments. Online learning environment used in this study consists of four main and 12 sub-components. The PSTs’ NOS views were assessed with the “Views of The Nature of Science–Form C” questionnaire and follow-up individual semi-structured interviews. The results indicated that most PSTs in both groups initially held naïve views about all aspects of NOS. Mid-way, both groups made some positive changes compared to pre-tests, with a slight advantage for the treatment group. At the end of the intervention, the treatment group achieved noticeably more substantial gains in their NOS understanding compared to the control group. The study provides empirical support for the effectiveness of online learning in augmenting and enhancing the impact of F2F and OST experiences in promoting preservice teachers' understanding of NOS.",Materials Science,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10639-024-13014-1,2
"BackgroundTo meet the growing demand for implementation science expertise, building capacity is a priority. Various training opportunities have emerged to meet this need. To ensure rigor and achievement of specific implementation science competencies, it is critical to systematically evaluate training programs.MethodsThe Penn Implementation Science Institute (PennISI) offers 4 days (20 h) of virtual synchronous training on foundational and advanced topics in implementation science. Through a pre-post design, this study evaluated the sixth PennISI, delivered in 2022. Surveys measures included 43 implementation science training evaluation competencies grouped into four thematic domains (e.g., items related to implementation science study design grouped into the “design, background, and rationale” competency category), course-specific evaluation criteria, and open-ended questions to evaluate change in knowledge and suggestions for improving future institutes. Mean composite scores were created for each of the competency themes. Descriptive statistics and thematic analysis were completed.ResultsOne hundred four (95.41% response rate) and 55 (50.46% response rate) participants completed the pre-survey and post-survey, respectively. Participants included a diverse cohort of individuals primarily affiliated with US-based academic institutions and self-reported as having novice or beginner-level knowledge of implementation science at baseline (81.73%). In the pre-survey, all mean composite scores for implementation science competencies were below one (i.e., beginner-level). Participants reported high value from the PennISI across standard course evaluation criteria (e.g., mean score of 3.77/4.00 for overall quality of course). Scores for all competency domains increased to a score between beginner-level and intermediate-level following training. In both the pre-survey and post-survey, competencies related to “definition, background, and rationale” had the highest mean composite score, whereas competencies related to “design and analysis” received the lowest score. Qualitative themes offered impressions of the PennISI, didactic content, PennISI structure, and suggestions for improvement. Prior experience with or knowledge of implementation science influenced many themes.ConclusionsThis evaluation highlights the strengths of an established implementation science institute, which can serve as a model for brief, virtual training programs. Findings provide insight for improving future program efforts to meet the needs of the heterogenous implementation science community (e.g., different disciplines and levels of implementation science knowledge).

"In this paper I demonstrate how zines (pronounced ‘zeen’, a word that is a contraction of ‘magazine’) about space science can be theorised as a site of science education at the margins. Through exploring different zines and their potential to create counter-narratives I offer a series of objects that might reshape how we teach and learn about outer space. Rhizomatically moving laterally between different zine, the paper charts how resisting hegemonic narratives; affective and cultural practices of science; and the integration of quotidian and cosmic is possible in these zines. These new narratives develop cautionary engagement with and resistance to expansionist, colonialist imaginaries that underpin so much cultural material about outer space produced by official actors.

"Biological structural materials not only exhibit remarkable mechanical properties but also often embody dynamic characteristics such as environmental responsiveness, autonomy, and self-healing, which are difficult to achieve in conventional engineering materials. By merging materials science, synthetic biology, and other disciplines, engineered living materials (ELMs) provide a promising solution to combine living organisms with abiotic components, thus facilitating the construction of functional “living” materials.

As an emerging branch of ELMs, structural ELMs aim to mimic living biological structural materials by achieving desired mechanical performance while maintaining important “living” characteristics. Here we summarize the recent progress and provide our perspectives for this emerging research area. We first summarize the superiority of structural ELMs by reviewing biological structural materials and biomimetic material design strategies. Subsequently, we provide a systematic discussion on the definition and classifications of structural ELMs, their mechanical performance, and physiological behaviors.

"High-quality science assessments are multi-dimensional. They promote disciplinary practices, core ideas, cross-cutting concepts, and science sense-making. In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of using generative artificial intelligence (GenAI), specifically multimodal large language models (MLLMs), to annotate and provide improvement ideas for K-12 science assessments. The AI-generated annotations critique how the assessments align with the three dimensions of the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) and suggest ideas to elicit students’ science sense-making. We outline our process with various prompting strategies: few-shot and zero-shot learning (prompting with and without examples), chain of thought (eliciting the MLLM’s reasoning), and sampling strategies (outputting high or low level of randomness). Overall, the AI annotations can reason about the alignment between the assessments and NGSS dimensions and overlap with annotations from K-12 educators. Annotations generated with few-shot learning generally score higher overall and provide more details than zero-shot prompts. Further, interviews with science teachers reveal that the MLLM annotations can support teachers’ reflection on instructional practices and assessment revision.

Interviews were analyzed through the framework of social cognitive career theory (SCCT) to identify the characteristics, beliefs, and experiences that featured prominently in their narrativizations of their career pathway into urban science education. Findings highlight a non-linear process of career choice characterized by three themes: rejecting traditional science careers, reevaluating their interests and skills for teaching, and prioritizing socially oriented career goals. Implications for enhancing the recruitment of undergraduate science majors into urban science teaching include transforming undergraduate science majors to value teaching careers and taking a more community-based approach to science teacher recruitment.",Materials Science,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11256-024-00695-8,2

Additionally, Several novel AL strategies were developed to enhance the development of probabilistic ML models. Through illustrative examples, this study demonstrated that AL could significantly boost ML training efficiency by labeling only a small subset of data samples while achieving exceptional model performance.",Materials Science,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00339-024-07728-9,2
"Spatiotemporal resolution is a cornerstone of bioelectronics, enabling precise observation and control of biological events at the molecular, cellular and tissue levels. In this Review, we analyse recent advancements in spatiotemporal resolution essential for applications such as neuroprosthetics, cardiac monitoring and biosensing, with a focus on devices utilizing electrical, electrochemical and optoelectronic signal transduction. We define the intrinsic and extrinsic parameters of spatial and temporal resolution and highlight high-performance materials and device architectures — including electrodes, transistors and optoelectronic interfaces — that drive these capabilities. Strategies such as device miniaturization, 3D fabrication and multifunctional integration are evaluated for their capacity to improve resolution, particularly within the complex microenvironments of biological tissues. However, challenges persist, including signal interference, device stability and the demand for reliable long-term operation. Overcoming these obstacles requires continuous innovation in materials science, device engineering and computational approaches. Enhanced spatiotemporal resolution holds promise for advancing diagnostic precision, therapeutic responsiveness and our understanding of dynamic biological systems across biomedical disciplines.",Materials Science,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1038/s41578-025-00798-y,2
"Teachers play a critical role in place-based education (PBE), an approach that emphasizes the use of local elements in teaching and learning. The purpose of this study was to explore how science teachers perceive the concept of locality and its integration into science education. The research was designed as a case study involving 92 science teachers working in Sakarya province of Türkiye. The findings reveal that, regardless of whether they actually integrated local elements into their lessons, teachers frequently emphasized the importance of doing so. They highlighted the educational value of integrating local elements, noting benefits for students’ academic achievement, motivation, local awareness, and sense of belonging. Teachers also reported benefits for their own professional development and job satisfaction. Furthermore, although the majority of participants had not previously heard of PBE, more than half nevertheless integrated local elements into their lessons. Teachers who were more familiar with local resources tended to integrate them more effectively; however, such integration often remained superficial, primarily due to limited knowledge of local assets and insufficient theoretical understanding of PBE. In addition, teachers reported challenges related to organizational processes, aligning curricular outcomes with local elements, and inadequate knowledge of local resources, emphasizing the need for support in these areas. Overall, the findings underscore the necessity of targeted interventions, including structured pre-service and in-service training programs, the provision of practical resources, and guidance on linking local elements to curricular objectives.",Materials Science,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11165-025-10297-3,2
"Although current science education reforms call for integration of engineering design into science teaching, many science teachers have no preparation in engineering. To address this problem, science teacher education programs have started preparing pre-service teachers (PSTs) in engineering design integrated science (EDIS) teaching. However, little is known about the structure of interventions and tasks for learning that are being used to prepare PSTs in EDIS teaching. We systematically examined the extant research studies on preparing PSTs in EDIS teaching for variations in their structures and tasks for learning and outcomes using a framework highlighting key structural and task-related components for preparing PSTs to teach science using the engineering design process. We also sought to consider in what ways those findings can inform future teacher preparation and research. Results show that most interventions were integrated into science teaching method courses and in field experiences. The longer intervention durations appeared to lead to better outcomes. Most studies reported PSTs’ increased understanding of the engineering design process, EDIS instructional planning, and self-efficacy for teaching engineering. However, some tasks for learning, such as providing PSTs with tools to evaluate EDIS instruction and its influence on student learning, supporting PSTs in examining their beliefs about EDIS teaching, and providing PSTs with an understanding of how to teach engineering design in diverse classrooms, were understudied in the studies reviewed. The findings have implications for science teacher preparation, science and engineering teaching and learning, and future research.",Materials Science,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10956-025-10247-8,2
"Thermoelectric materials offer unique opportunities to convert otherwise wasted thermal energy into useful electrical energy. Many of the traditional thermoelectric materials, such as bismuth telluride and lead telluride, contain scarce and toxic elements. This has motivated the search for new high-performance materials containing readily-available and environmentally-less-damaging elements. Numerous advances in the development of high-performance thermoelectric materials exploit fundamental chemical-bonding principles. Much of the thermoelectric literature lies at the interface of chemistry, physics and materials science. In this Review, progress in the design of high-performance materials is discussed in terms of ideas that are familiar in chemistry. This includes the influence of concepts such as bonding heterogeneity, covalency, polarizability, lone pairs and different bonding models, including multi-centre, metallic and iono-covalent archetypes.

"This systematic review summarized 42 selected empirical studies on the representations of nature of science (NOS) in science textbooks guided by three theoretical frameworks, which are the four-theme scientific literacy (SL), the consensus view on nature of science (CV), and the family resemblance approach to the nature of science (FRA). This review aimed to identify research trends, research foci, and research results of the reviewed studies under each framework. Concerning research trends, the most prevalent and widely used framework was CV framework, followed by SL, and the least was FRA. Moreover, it took an increasing trend in the application of CV and FRA framework while there was a decreasing tendency for the application of SL framework. With regard to research foci, articles that utilized the SL framework exclusively concentrated on “the balance of four scientific literacy themes.” Articles that applied the CV framework identified four research foci: “the quality of and approach to addressing NOS aspects,” “the quantity and distribution of addressing NOS aspects,” “the factors that influenced NOS representations,” and “the content relation of NOS aspects.” Studies that applied the FRA framework included three foci: “the quantity and distribution of addressing NOS aspects,” “the quality of and approach to addressing NOS aspects,” and “the category differentiation of FRA.” In respect of research results, NOS was poorly represented in science textbooks, irrespective of the NOS framework utilized, country, discipline, and educational level.

"Climate Change Education is an increasing focus of curriculum advocacy across the globe, as countries come to terms with the future threats posed by this socio-ecological crisis. Both Science and the Social Sciences are important for the knowledge and decision-making needed by an appropriately informed and active citizenry. While there is increasing research on the representation of anthropogenic climate change (ACC) in curricula globally, little attention has been paid to how textbooks in different countries incorporate ACC content. Yet, in any country, teachers’ knowledge and practice is strongly shaped by the resources at their disposal. In different countries, textbooks have an important, but differing place in subject teaching and learning cultures and in teacher learning. This study involves a comparative analysis of Science (including Geography) textbooks in the middle years of schooling in three countries - Taiwan, Finland and Australia – to interrogate the amount and nature of anthropogenic climate change content featured in these. We discuss the methodological approach to coding and comparative analyses and interpret the comparative results in terms of the different cultures of Science teaching of climate change in the three countries. We identify patterns of incorporation of different aspects across the different Science disciplines, showing variation in representation of these across disciplines and countries, identifying both silences and opportunities for representation.

"BackgroundKnee osteoarthritis (OA) is a multifactorial form of rheumatic condition contributing to physical and psychological factors. Treatments have been provided solely and often compared with each other. An alternative view is that combined treatments addressing physical and psychological factors may result in more benefits. This study aimed to investigate the effect of pain neuroscience education (PNE) followed by Pilates exercises (PEs) in participants with knee OA, compared to PE alone.MethodsIn this two-arm assessor-blind pilot randomized controlled trial, fifty-four community-dwelling adults with knee OA were randomly assigned to the PNE followed by PEs and PEs groups (27 in each group). The study was conducted between early July 2021 and early March 2022 at the university’s health center. Primary outcomes were Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) subscales of pain and physical limitation and secondary outcomes were Pain Catastrophizing Scale, Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia, Pain Self-Efficacy Questionnaire, and Timed ""Up & Go"" test covering function. The primary and secondary outcomes were measured at baseline and eight weeks post-treatment. A general linear mixed model was used for between-group comparison with a statistical significance level of 0.05.ResultsSignificant within-group differences were observed in all outcomes in both groups at post-treatment. There were no statistically between-group differences in pain (adjusted mean difference: -0.8; 95% CI -2.2 to 0.7;p= 0.288), physical limitation (adjusted mean difference: -0.4; 95% CI -4 to 3.1;p= 0.812) and function (adjusted mean difference: -0.8; 95% CI -1.8 to 0.1;p= 0.069) at eight weeks. For pain catastrophizing (adjusted mean difference: -3.9; 95% CI -7.2 to -0.6;p= 0.021), kinesiophobia (adjusted mean difference: -4.2; 95% CI -8.1 to -0.4;p= 0.032), and self-efficacy (adjusted mean difference: 6.1; 95% CI 0.7 to 11.5;p= 0.028) statistically between-group improvements were observed favoring PNE followed by PEs group after the treatment.ConclusionsCombining PNE with PEs could have superior effects on psychological characteristics but not on pain, physical limitation, and function, compared to PEs alone.

"More than a hundred genes have been identified that, when disrupted, impart large risk for autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Current knowledge about the encoded proteins — although incomplete — points to a very wide range of developmentally dynamic and diverse biological processes. Moreover, the core symptoms of ASD involve distinctly human characteristics, presenting challenges to interpreting evolutionarily distant model systems. Indeed, despite a decade of striking progress in gene discovery, an actionable understanding of pathobiology remains elusive. Increasingly, convergent neuroscience approaches have been recognized as an important complement to traditional uses of genetics to illuminate the biology of human disorders. These methods seek to identify intersection among molecular-level, cellular-level and circuit-level functions across multiple risk genes and have highlighted developing excitatory neurons in the human mid-gestational prefrontal cortex as an important pathobiological nexus in ASD. In addition, neurogenesis, chromatin modification and synaptic function have emerged as key potential mediators of genetic vulnerability. The continued expansion of foundational ‘omics’ data sets, the application of higher-throughput model systems and incorporating developmental trajectories and sex differences into future analyses will refine and extend these results. Ultimately, a systems-level understanding of ASD genetic risk holds promise for clarifying pathobiology and advancing therapeutics.",Neuroscience,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1038/s41583-022-00576-7,0
"This dataset was collected to study the functional consequences of age-related hearing loss for the auditory nerve, which carries acoustic information from the periphery to the central auditory system. Using high-impedance glass electrodes, raw voltage traces and spike times were recorded from more than one thousand single fibres of the auditory nerve of young-adult, middle-aged, and old Mongolian gerbils raised in a quiet environment. The dataset contains not only responses to simple acoustic stimuli to characterize the fibres, but also to more complex stimuli, such as speech logatomes in background noise and Schroeder-phase stimuli. A software toolbox is provided to search through the dataset, to plot various analysed outcomes, and to give insight into the analyses. This dataset may serve as a valuable resource to test further hypotheses about age-related hearing loss.

"Individual differences in human brain structure, function, and behavior can be attributed to genetic variations, environmental exposures, and their interactions. Although genome-wide association studies have identified many genetic variants associated with brain imaging phenotypes, environmental exposures associated with these phenotypes remain largely unknown. Here, we propose that environmental neuroscience should pay more attention on exploring the associations between lifetime environmental exposures (exposome) and brain imaging phenotypes and identifying both cumulative environmental effects and their vulnerable age windows during the life course. Exposome-neuroimaging association studies face several challenges including the accurate measurement of the totality of environmental exposures varied in space and time, the highly correlated structure of the exposome, and the lack of standardized approaches for exposome-wide association studies. By agnostically scanning the effects of environmental exposures on brain imaging phenotypes and their interactions with genomic variations, exposome-neuroimaging association analyses will improve our understanding of causal factors associated with individual differences in brain structure and function as well as their relations with cognitive abilities and neuropsychiatric disorders.",Neuroscience,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1038/s41380-022-01669-6,0

"Scientific literature suggests that Neuroticism is an important predictor in understanding individual differences in anxiety-related coping styles such as vigilance (positive association) and cognitive avoidance (negative association). Considering Pankseppian Affective Neuroscience (AN) theory could contribute to understand these relationships more in-depth, because the evolutionary old subcortical brain systems of FEAR, SADNESS, and ANGER might represent brain-anatomical bottom-up drivers of Neuroticism.N= 594 German participants (n= 170 males; mostly student background) andN= 332 Chinese participants (n= 72 males; mostly student background) completed the Affective Neuroscience Personality Scales (ANPS) and the Mainz Coping Inventory (Angstbewältigungsinventar; ABI) to assess individual differences in primary emotional traits and anxiety-related coping styles, respectively. As hypothesized, associations between the three emotional systems and the two coping styles cognitive avoidance and vigilance were observed. There were some differences in correlations between the Chinese and German samples, mainly regarding associations between ANGER and cognitive avoidance. Moreover, linear regression analyses revealed FEAR as a main predictor of vigilance (positive) and cognitive avoidance (negative) in the German sample. In the Chinese sample, FEAR was the main predictor of cognitive avoidance (negative), only; for vigilance SADNESS (positive) was the main predictor.

"The anti-hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) effect of the active ingredients of natural Chinese herbal medicine has become a hot topic at home and abroad. A list of studies evidence the therapeutic efficacy of Dahuang (DH) or Dangshen (DS) against HCC, but the combination effect of DH and DS in HCC treatment is rarely reported and the molecular mechanism of the drug pairs is not yet clear. Therefore, in this study, the combined effects and potential mechanisms of DH and DS drug pairs were investigated through network pharmacology, bioinformatics, molecular docking, and a series of pharmacological experiments, including the MTT assay, clone formation, wound healing, JC-1 staining, and western blotting. In total, 140 intersection targets between the DH–DS drug pairs and HCC were identified. In the PPI network, the top ten hub targets with the highest node connection values were VEGFA, AKT, CTNNB1, EGFR, TNF, CASP3, HRAS, SRC, JUN, and ESR1. GO functional and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis involved 289 biological processes, 33 cellular components, 57 molecular functions, and 143 signaling pathways. Bioinformatic analysis indicated that EGFR and AKT were promising candidate genes that can serve as diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for HCC. β-sitosterol from the DH drug and luteolin from the DS drug were found as promising small molecules for HCC. The experimental results showed that the combination of β-sitosterol and luteolin was more potent in suppressing cell proliferation, migration and inducing cell apoptosis when compared to β-sitosterol or luteolin alone. The western blot and molecular docking studies demonstrated that the potential mechanism may be related to the EGFR/AKT signaling pathway. In summary, the combination of DH and DS may resist cell proliferation, migration and promote apoptosis activity through the EGFR/AKT signaling pathway, which provides new insights for further exploring plant extract treatment for HCC.",Bioinformatics,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12032-025-02738-w,1
"Liver fibrosis is a major global health concern, contributing to high mortality rates worldwide. MicroRNAs have emerged as important players in the diagnosis and treatment of various diseases. Notably, a recent bioinformatics study has reported that miR-30b-3p and miR-3162-3p are downregulated in human fibrotic livers. This investigation aimed to explore the alterations of these two microRNAs during the progression and regression of fibrosis in mice. Over an eight-week period, liver fibrosis was induced in 40 male C57BL/6 mice using carbon tetrachloride (CCl₄), with groups of mice sacrificed at 4, 6, and 8 weeks to assess fibrosis. Each group received twice-weekly injections of CCl₄ or corn oil, totaling 8, 12, or 16 injections, depending on the group. Liver histopathology revealed various degrees of fibrosis, and Real-time PCR was used to analyze the expression of miR-30b-3p and miR-3162-3p. Serum ALT, AST, ALP, and tissue hydroxyproline were also measured. Finally, these miRNAs were bioinformatically analyzed in human liver tissues. MiR-30b-3p was downregulated in proportion to the severity of fibrosis, while it was upregulated during fibrosis regression. Moreover, miR-3162-3p was upregulated in the early stages of fibrosis but did not show significant changes during the advanced phase or regression. Serum ALT, AST, ALP, and liver tissue hydroxyproline were significantly higher in fibrosis, while these markers decreased in the regression group (P-value < 0.05). Bioinformatics analysis showed that both miR-30b-3p and miR-3162-3p were downregulated in human fibrotic livers. The decrease in miR-30b-3p expression could be associated with hepatic fibrosis progression, while its increase suggests involvement in fibrosis regression. However, the role of miR-3162-3p remains unclear and warrants further investigation, especially regarding its differences between animal and human models.",Bioinformatics,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00580-024-03620-3,1
"BackgroundAtherosclerosis (AS) is increasingly recognized as a chronic inflammatory disease that significantly compromises vascular health and acts as a major contributor to cardiovascular diseases. Advancements in lipidomics and metabolomics have unveiled the complex role of fatty acid metabolism (FAM) in both healthy and pathological states. However, the specific roles of fatty acid metabolism-related genes (FAMGs) in shaping therapeutic approaches, especially in AS, remain largely unexplored and are a subject of ongoing research.MethodsThis study employed advanced bioinformatics techniques to identify and validate FAMGs associated with AS. We conducted differential expression analysis on a select list of 49 candidate FAMGs. GSEA and GSVA were utilized to elucidate the potential biological roles and pathways of these FAMGs. Subsequently, Lasso regression and SVM-RFE were applied to identify key hub genes and assess the diagnostic efficacy of seven FAMGs in distinguishing AS. The study also explored the correlation between these hub FAMGs and clinical features of AS. Validation of the expression levels of the seven FAMGs was performed using datasets GSE43292 and GSE9820.ResultsThe study pinpointed seven FAMGs with a close association to AS: ACSBG2, ELOVL4, ACSL3, CPT2, ALDH2, HSD17B10, and CPT1B. Analysis of their biological functions underscored their significant involvement in critical processes such as fatty acid metabolism, small molecule catabolism, and nucleoside bisphosphate metabolism. The diagnostic potential of these seven FAMGs in AS differentiation showed promising results.ConclusionsThis research has successfully identified seven key FAMGs implicated in AS, offering novel insights into the pathophysiology of the disease. These findings not only contribute to our understanding of AS but also present potential biomarkers for the disease, opening avenues for more effective monitoring and progression tracking of AS.",Bioinformatics,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s13019-024-03199-4,1
"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic, progressive form of pulmonary fibrosis of unknown etiology. Despite ongoing research, there is currently no cure for this disease. Recent studies have highlighted the significance of competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA) regulatory networks in IPF development. Therefore, this study investigated the ceRNA network associated with IPF pathogenesis. We obtained gene expression datasets (GSE32538, GSE32537, GSE47460, and GSE24206) from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database and analyzed them using bioinformatics tools to identify differentially expressed messenger RNAs (DEmRNAs), microRNAs (DEmiRNAs), and long non-coding RNAs (DElncRNA). For DEmRNAs, we conducted an enrichment analysis, constructed protein–protein interaction networks, and identified hub genes. Additionally, we predicted the target genes of differentially expressed mRNAs and their interacting long non-coding RNAs using various databases. Subsequently, we screened RNA molecules with ceRNA regulatory relations in the lncACTdb database based on the screening results. Furthermore, we performed disease and functional enrichment analyses and pathway prediction for miRNAs in the ceRNA network. We also validated the expression levels of candidate DEmRNAs through quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and analyzed the correlation between the expression of these candidate DEmRNAs and the percent predicted pre-bronchodilator forced vital capacity [%predicted FVC (pre-bd)]. We found that three ceRNA regulatory axes, specifically KCNQ1OT1/XIST/NEAT1-miR-20a-5p-ITGB8, XIST-miR-146b-5p/miR-31-5p- MMP16, and NEAT1-miR-31-5p-MMP16, have the potential to significantly affect IPF progression.

"BackgroundKeloid disorder (KD) encompasses a spectrum of fibroproliferative dermal conditions, the pathogenesis remains complex and incompletely understood. This study sought to identify biomarkers and potential therapeutic targets for KD through an integrative bioinformatics approach and machine learning analysis of RNA sequencing data.MethodsRNA sequencing was performed on skin tissue samples from 13 patients with KD and 14 healthy controls. Using weighted gene co-expression network analysis and differential expression analysis revealed differentially expressed key module genes, and the CytoHubba plugin identified candidate genes. Subsequently analyzed using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and support vector machine recursive feature elimination (SVM-RFE) methods to pinpoint feature genes associated with KD. Following this, biomarkers were determined through expression level validation, enrichment analysis, and immune infiltration analysis.ResultsA total of 420 differentially expressed key module genes were identified, and the top 10 genes with DMNC values were selected as candidate genes. Five feature genes were selected through LASSO and SVM-RFE, with NID2, MFAP2, COL8A1, and P4HA3 showing significant expression differences between KD and control samples, along with consistent expression patterns across datasets, identified as potential biomarkers. These four biomarkers were proved to possess high diagnostic potential, and they were found to exhibit significant positive correlations with one another. Functional enrichment analysis indicated that the primary KEGG pathways associated with these biomarkers included “steroid hormone biosynthesis” and “cytokine–cytokine receptor interaction.” Moreover, immune infiltration analysis revealed that the four biomarkers were negatively correlated with type 17 T helper cells and positively correlated with 15 immune cell types, including activated B cells and central memory CD4 T cells.ConclusionIn conclusion, NID2, MFAP2, COL8A1, and P4HA3 were identified as key biomarkers for KD, offering new avenues for more targeted and effective diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for managing this condition.",Bioinformatics,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12920-025-02174-9,1
"SummaryThe study, using data from Chongqing, China, and employing Mendelian randomization along with bioinformatics, establishes a causal link between asthma and osteoporosis, beyond glucocorticoid effects. Asthma may contribute to osteoporosis by accelerating bone turnover through inflammatory factors, disrupting the coupling between osteoblasts and osteoclasts, ultimately leading to osteoporosis.IntroductionAsthma and osteoporosis are prevalent health conditions with substantial public health implications. However, their potential interplay and the underlying mechanisms have not been fully elucidated. Previous research has primarily focused on the impact of glucocorticoids on osteoporosis, often overlooking the role of asthma itself.MethodsWe conducted a multi-stage stratified random sampling in Chongqing, China and excluded individuals with a history of glucocorticoid use. Participants underwent comprehensive health examinations, and their clinical data, including asthma status, were recorded. Logistic regression and Mendelian randomization were employed to investigate the causal link between asthma and osteoporosis. Furthermore, bioinformatics analyses and serum biomarker assessments were conducted to explore potential mechanistic pathways.ResultsWe found a significant association between asthma and osteoporosis, suggesting a potential causal link. Mendelian Randomization analysis provided further support for this causal link. Bioinformatics analyses revealed that several molecular pathways might mediate the impact of asthma on bone health. Serum alkaline phosphatase levels were significantly elevated in the asthma group, suggesting potential involvement in bone turnover.ConclusionOur study confirms a causal link between asthma and osteoporosis and highlights the importance of considering asthma in osteoporosis prediction models. It also suggests that asthma may accelerate osteoporosis by increasing bone turnover through inflammatory factors, disrupting the coupling between osteoblasts and osteoclasts, ultimately leading to bone loss.",Bioinformatics,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00198-024-07037-0,1
"Cardiomyopathy is a type of cardiovascular disorder that is a primary cause of death globally, killing millions of people each year. Cardiomyopathy detection and early diagnosis are crucial in reducing negative health effects. Thus, this study aims to use single cell RNA sequencing, and bioinformatics analysis to uncover dendritic cell-specific biomarkers, gene ontology, pathways, regulatory interaction networks, and protein-chemical compounds related to the molecular mechanism of cardiomyopathy progression. Two RNAseq datasets GSE65446 and GSE155495 also were evaluated to identify significant biomarkers in cardiomyopathy, and 123 mutual DEGs appeared between scRNAseq and RNAseq datasets. In addition, the DAVID online platform and FunRich software were utilized to detect cell communication in innate immune responses, type 1 IFN, antigen processing and presentation, allograft rejection and viral infection significant gene ontology and metabolic pathways in cardiomyopathy. The protein-protein interaction (PPI) network revealed five key hub proteins (ITGAX, IRF7, MX1, HLA-B, and IRF1). Following that, several transcription factors (GATA2, FOXC1, SREBF1, STAT3, and NFKB1) as well as microRNA (hsa-mir-26a-5p, hsa-mir-129-2-3p, etc.) were predicted. Prospective chemical substances such as tretinoin, valproic acid, and arsenic trioxide have been predicted to be linked to cardiomyopathy treatment. The acceptable value of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis revealed that biomarkers play critical roles in cardiomyopathy. This study identifies molecular indicators at the RNA and protein levels that may be useful in improving understanding of molecular causes, early diagnosis, and devising favorable cardiomyopathy treatment.

"The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has resulted in a remarkable threat to global public health over the past few years. Despite the tremendous studies of COVID-19 ongoing, few have focused on the viral impact on the ocular surface. As one of the most common inflammatory diseases of the ocular surface, pterygium could be triggered under multiple environmental exposures. In the present work, we aimed at investigating the potential interactions between pterygium and COVID-19. Based on bioinformatic tools, we compared databases of COVID-19 and pterygium and screened for common differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Multifactor regulatory network and co-expression network of the common DEGs were analyzed. In vitro experiments, including siRNA knockdown using human conjunctival fibroblasts (HConFs) confirmed the bioinformatics results. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis implied that immune response was associated with COVID-19-induced ocular events. We then identified five common DEGs, includingERP27, SYTL5, STXBP6, EXTL1andDIO2, which was further validated by in vitro experiments. Three hub genes were further extracted which includedSYTL5, STXBP6andERP27through protein–protein interactions (PPI) network. Furthermore, we illustrated a regulatory network consisting of eight transcription factors (STAT6B, GATA1, POU2F2, PGR, RBPJ, STAT3, CRTC1andHMGA1) and one microRNA (hsa-miR-384). Overall, we investigated the common link between SARS-CoV-2 and pterygium in the modulation of gene profiles on the ocular surface. Our study proposed a novel insight into the common pathogenic mechanisms between COVID-19 and pterygium, which are associated with immune dysregulation and pathological proliferation, indicating a viral impact on pterygium susceptibility. This innovative perspective may enable a more comprehensive understanding and advance towards improved clinical prevention and treatment.",Bioinformatics,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s41065-025-00500-w,1
"BackgroundEpigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), a frequently studied catechin in green tea, has been shown to be involved in the antiproliferation and apoptosis of human Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) cells. However, the pharmacological targets and mechanism by which EGCG can combat NPC patients remain to be studied in detail.MethodsNetwork pharmacology and bioinformatics were employed to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying EGCG’s therapeutic effects on NPC, with an emphasis on developing a prognostic risk model and identifying potential therapeutic targets.ResultsA novel prognostic risk model was developed using univariate Cox regression, LASSO regression and multivariable Cox regression analyses, incorporating six genes to stratify patients into low- and highrisk groups. Kaplan–Meier analysis demonstrated significantly shorter progression-free survival in the high-risk group. The model’s accuracy was further validated using time-dependent Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves. ESTIMATE analysis revealed significantly higher immune, stromal and overall ESTIMATE scores in the low-risk group compared to the high-risk group. Immune profiling indicated significant differences in five immune cell subtypes (memory B cells, regulatory T cells (Tregs), gamma delta T cells, activated NK cells and activated dendritic cells) between the two risk groups. Additionally, the low-risk group showed greater sensitivity to conventional chemotherapeutic agents. Immunohistochemistry and molecular docking analyses identified CYCS and MYL12B as promising targets for EGCG treatment.ConclusionThis study utilised network pharmacology and bioinformatics to identify shared genes between EGCG and NPC, aiming to elucidate the molecular mechanisms through which EGCG inhibits NPC and to develop a prognostic model for assessing patient outcomes.

"The lactylation modification has been implicated in several cancer types; however, the role of lactylation modification-related genes in esophageal carcinoma (EC) remains underexplored. Utilizing a set of 16 lactylation modification-related genes, cohorts of patients with EC were stratified into two distinct clusters, characterized by significant disparities in both survival outcomes and the immune microenvironment. An extensive bioinformatics analysis unveiled 382 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between these two clusters. A subsequent univariate Cox regression analysis identified 24 DEGs specifically associated with lactylation, forming the basis of a constructed lactylation-related score. The resultant lactylation-related score exhibited notable predictive efficacy for survival and other clinicopathological traits, which was validated through calibration curves, Kaplan–Meier survival curves and the Wilcoxon test. Moreover, the lactylation-related score displayed a close correlation with immune cell infiltration in EC. Notable differential expressions of immune checkpoints and regulators were observed between groups stratified by low and high lactylation scores, with the latter exhibiting a more favorable response to anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy. Furthermore, the expression profile of U2 snRNP associated SURP domain containing (U2SURP), a constituent of the lactylation-related score, underwent both ex vivo and in vitro validation. The expression of U2SURP was significantly associated with lactylation levels, histological grade and tumor stage. Notably, knockdown of U2SURP expression inhibited the lactylation levels, immune genes IL-1A and IL-1B, proliferation, migration and invasion of EC cells. In conclusion, the lactylation-related score developed in the present study showed promise in predicting the prognosis and immunotherapeutic responses among patients with EC. Moreover, the identification of U2SUPR as a novel oncogene in EC suggests its potential as a prospective therapeutic target for EC treatment.",Bioinformatics,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12026-024-09589-z,1
"The calcium-binding protein S100A9 has emerged as a pivotal biomolecular actor in oncology, implicated in numerous malignancies. This comprehensive bioinformatics study transcends traditional boundaries, investigating the prognostic and therapeutic potential of S100A9 across diverse neoplastic entities. Leveraging a wide array of bioinformatics tools and publicly available cancer genomics databases, such as TCGA, we systematically examined the S100A9 gene. Our approach included differential expression analysis, mutational burden assessment, protein interaction networks, and survival analysis. This robust computational framework provided a high-resolution view of S100A9’s role in cancer biology. The study meticulously explored S100A9’s oncogenic facets, incorporating comprehensive analyses of its relationship with prognosis, tumor mutational burden (TMB), microsatellite instability (MSI), DNA methylation, and immune cell infiltration across various tumor types. This study presents a panoramic view of S100A9 expression across a spectrum of human cancers, revealing a heterogeneous expression landscape. Elevated S100A9 expression was detected in malignancies such as BLCA (Bladder Urothelial Carcinoma), CESC (Cervical squamous cell carcinoma and endocervical adenocarcinoma), COAD (Colon adenocarcinoma), ESCA (Esophageal carcinoma), and GBM (Glioblastoma multiforme), while reduced expression was noted in BRCA (Breast invasive carcinoma), HNSC (Head and Neck squamous cell carcinoma), and KICH (Kidney Chromophobe). This disparate expression pattern suggests that S100A9’s role in cancer biology is multifaceted and context-dependent. Prognostically, S100A9 expression correlates variably with patient outcomes across different cancer types. Furthermore, its expression is intricately associated with TMB and MSI in nine cancer types. Detailed examination of six selected tumors—BRCA, CESC, KIRC (Kidney renal clear cell carcinoma), LUSC (Lung squamous cell carcinoma), SKCM (Skin Cutaneous Melanoma); STAD (Stomach adenocarcinoma)—revealed a negative correlation of S100A9 expression with the infiltration of most immune cells, but a positive correlation with neutrophils, M1 macrophages, and activated NK cells, highlighting the complex interplay between S100A9 and the tumor immune environment. This bioinformatics synthesis posits S100A9 as a significant player in cancer progression, offering valuable prognostic insights. The data underscore the utility of S100A9 as a prognostic biomarker and its potential as a therapeutic target. The therapeutic implications are profound, suggesting that modulation of S100A9 activity could significantly impact cancer management strategies.",Bioinformatics,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1038/s41598-024-70223-x,1
"γ-globin genes (HBG1andHBG2) are usually expressed during fetal life, and almost no expression after birth. Therefore, the reactivation ofHBGis a key target for the treatment of hemoglobinopathy.ZFP64is a C2H2 type zinc finger transcription factor, which has been shown to play an important role in the maintenance of gene expression in mixed lineage leukemia, and other C2H2 type zinc finger transcription factors (such asZFP410andZFP644) have been shown to regulate the expression of fetal hemoglobin (HbF) in thalassemia. This study aims to investigate the effect ofZFP64on mRNA expression ofHBG. We performed bioinformatics analyses using the Gene Ontology (GO), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), and protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks to identify genes and transcription factors associated withZFP64. ZFP64was knocked out in K562 and HUDEP-2 cell lines by CRISPR-Cas9 electroporation, and the transcription levels ofZFP64,HBBandHBGwere analyzed. In undifferentiated and 7-day differentiated HUDEP-2 cells, knocking downZFP64resulted in a 1.5-fold and 2.5-fold increase inHBGmRNA expression, respectively (p< 0.05). These findings suggest thatZFP64is a potential regulator ofHBGexpression and warrants further investigation as a therapeutic target in hemoglobinopathies.",Bioinformatics,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12013-025-01776-5,1
"BackgroundSpontaneous abortion, affecting over 20% of pregnancies, presents significant physical and psychological burdens. While chromosomal aneuploidy and environmental factors contribute to its etiology, the role of maternal genetic and psychiatric factors remains underexplored. Emerging evidence links psychiatric disorders, particularly bipolar disorder, to increased spontaneous abortion risk, potentially via immune or neuroendocrine dysregulation. This research examines the causal link between bipolar disorder and spontaneous abortion using mendelian randomization (MR) and delves into molecular mechanisms via bioinformatics analysis.ResultsInitial MR analysis revealed no direct causal association between bipolar disorder and spontaneous abortion (odds ratio (OR)=1.05, 95% Confidence Interval (CI): 0.99–1.12). However, single-nucleotide-polymorphism-level analysis identified rs1054442 as a potential mediator, linked to reduced expression ofDDN, a gene implicated in neurodevelopment and immune modulation. Microarray data demonstrated significant downregulation ofDDNin endometrial tissue from spontaneous abortion patients (logFold Change(logFC)=− 1.21,p=0.004). Concurrently, immune checkpoint genes—CTLA4,IGSF8,ITPRIPL1, andTIGIT—exhibited altered expression patterns, suggesting disrupted immune tolerance at the maternal–fetal interface.ConclusionsAlthough bipolar disorder does not directly elevate spontaneous abortion risk, genetic variants associated with the disorder may contribute to immune dysfunction viaDDNdysregulation, indirectly predisposing to spontaneous abortion. These discoveries point to the potential influence of maternal immune modulation in the origins of spontaneous abortion and indicate therapeutic targets for those at risk. Further studies are needed to validate these mechanisms and explore clinical interventions targeting immune checkpoint pathways.",Bioinformatics,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s43088-025-00674-2,1
"ObjectivesSystemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a life-threatening autoimmune disorder causing multi-organ damage. Current diagnostic methods are hindered by inadequate sensitivity and specificity of conventional biomarkers, which frequently delay diagnosis. Therefore, identifying reliable diagnostic biomarkers for SLE remains critically needed.MethodsSLE microarray datasets from Gene Expression Omnibus were preprocessed. Potential SLE diagnostic biomarkers were identified through differential expression analysis, weighted gene co-expression network analysis, and machine learning feature selection. Diagnostic models were constructed based on the candidate genes, optimized with nine machine learning algorithms. The expression levels of the candidate genes were further validated in clinical samples using real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), with their clinical relevance assessed statistically.ResultsFour candidate genes—HECT and RLD Domain Containing E3 Ubiquitin Protein Ligase 5 (HERC5), Interferon Alpha Inducible Protein 6 (IFI6), Interferon Inducible Protein with Tetratricopeptide Repeats 3 (IFIT3), and 2′-5′-Oligoadenylate Synthetase Like (OASL)—showed potential as SLE diagnostic biomarkers, with significantly higher expression in SLE patients versus controls. Individual receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves for the candidate genes showed area under the curve (AUC) values exceeding 0.8 (P< 0.001), while nomogram model achieved superior accuracy (AUC = 0.905,P< 0.001). Optimized diagnostic models demonstrated robust performance in different datasets (AUC > 0.85,P< 0.001), specifically distinguishing SLE from hepatitis C, multiple sclerosis, and tuberculosis. Clinical validation confirmed these findings, with the gene combination outperforming conventional biomarkers in assessing disease activity (AUC = 0.776,P< 0.001).ConclusionsHERC5,IFI6,IFIT3, andOASLcan serve as potential diagnostic biomarkers for SLE.

"BackgroundType II diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is strongly linked with a heightened risk of coronary artery disease (CAD). Exploring biological targets common to T2DM and CAD is essential for CAD intervention strategies.MethodsRNA transcriptome data from CAD and T2DM patients and single-cell transcriptional data from myocardial tissue of CAD patients were used for bioinformatics analysis. Differential analysis and Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) were conducted to identify hub genes associated with the CAD Index (CADi) in these cells. We then intersected these genes with differentially expressed genes in the T2DM dataset to validate the key gene FGF7. Additional analyses included immune analysis, drug sensitivity, competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) networks, and smooth muscle cell -related functional analysis.ResultsAn abnormally high proportion of smooth muscle cells was observed in CAD tissues compared to normal cardiomyocytes. The gene FGF7, which encodes the keratinocyte growth factor 7 protein, showed increased expression in both CAD and T2DM and was significantly positively correlated with the CADi (correlation = 0.24,p< 0.05). FGF7 expression was inversely correlated with CD4+and CD8+T-cell immune infiltration and correlated with the cardiovascular drugs. Overexpression of FGF7 in CAD samples enhanced interactions with mononuclear macrophages and influenced the metabolism of alanine, glutamate, nicotinamide, and retinol. We also identified that hsa-miR-15a-5p, hsa-miR-373-3p, hsa-miR-20a-5p, and hsa-miR-372-3p could regulate FGF7 expression.ConclusionFGF7 serves as a critical shared biological target for T2DM and CAD, playing a significant role in CAD progression with potential therapeutic implications.",Bioinformatics,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12872-024-04266-3,1
"The molecular link between endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) remains elusive. Our study aimed to uncover core mechanisms and new therapeutic targets for IPF. By analyzing gene expression profiles from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database, we identified 1519 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and 11 ERS-related genes (ERSRGs) diagnostic for IPF. Using weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) and differential expression analysis, key genes linked to IPF were pinpointed. CIBERSORT was used to assess immune cell infiltration, while the Gene Ontology (GO) and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses were performed to explore biological mechanisms. In three GEO datasets (GSE150910, GSE92592, and GSE124685), the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis showed area under the ROC curve (AUC) > 0.7 for all ERSRGs. The Connectivity Map (CMap) database was used to predict small molecules modulating IPF signatures. The molecular docking energies of mirdametinib with protein targets ranged from − 5.1643 to − 8.0154 kcal/mol, while those of linsitinib ranged from − 5.6031 to − 7.902 kcal/mol. Molecular docking and animal experiments were performed to validate the therapeutic potential of identified compounds, with mirdametinib showing specific effects in a murine bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis model. In vitro experiments indicated that mirdametinib may alleviate pulmonary fibrosis by reducing ERS via the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway.

"Breast cancer (BRCA) is the most widespread malignant tumor and the leading cause of death in women. BRCA treatments vary based on the presence of estrogen receptors (ER). Generally, cancer preventive and therapy options for ER-negative BRCA are limited compared to ER-positive BRCA. Therefore, this study investigates the key genes predicting poor prognosis for ER-negative BRCA through the application of LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) and bioinformatics analysis. These methods are analyzed using a dataset GSE7390 that contains 198 untreated lymph node-negative BRCA patients with gene expressions and clinical information. Differentially Expressed Genes (DEGs) between ER-negative and ER-positive BRCA are found using GEO2R. Here, the regularized regression reduces the dimensionality of DEGs by selecting necessary genes. Later, Support Vector Machines for Survival and Random Survival Forest methods were implemented to construct survival predictive models. Comparatively, LASSO holds higher C-index and AUC values with better prediction accuracy and it selects 28 DEGs consisting of 14 upregulated and 14 downregulated genes. Among them, LCN2 expression is significantly downregulated and ZMYND10 expression is significantly upregulated in tumor tissues compared to normal tissue using GEPIA2. Also, both genes are statistically significant in survival rates for TCGA BRCA patients (p< 0.05). Hence, this study highlights higher LCN2 and low ZMYND10 expression in ER-negative BRCA associated with a poor prognosis. Consequently, LCN2 and ZMYND10 genes can be used to predict and serve as potential biomarkers for future diagnosis and treatment in ER-negative BRCA.",Bioinformatics,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s41096-024-00187-8,1

"ObjectiveHuman integral membrane enzymes are essential for catalyzing a wide range of biochemical reactions and regulating key cellular processes. However, studying these enzymes remains challenging due to their hydrophobic nature, which necessitates the use of detergents. This study explores whether applying the QTY code can reduce the hydrophobicity of these enzymes while preserving their structures and functions, thus facilitating bioinformatics analysis of six key integral membrane enzymes: MGST2, LTC4S, PTGES, FACE1, STEA4, and SCD.MethodsThe water-soluble QTY analogs of the six membrane enzymes were predicted using AlphaFold3. The predicted structures were superposed with CyroEM determined native structures in PyMOL to observe changes in structure and protein-ligand binding ability.ResultsThe native membrane enzymes superposed well with their respective QTY analogs, with the root mean square deviation (RMSD) ranging from 0.273 Å to 0.875 Å. Surface hydrophobic patches on the QTY analogs were significantly reduced. Importantly, the protein-ligand interactions in FACE1 and STEA4 were largely preserved, indicating maintained functionality.ConclusionOur structural bioinformatics studies using the QTY code and AlphaFold3 not only provide the opportunities of designing more water-soluble integral membrane enzymes, but also use these water-soluble QTY analogs as antigens for therapeutic monoclonal antibody discovery to specifically target the key integral membrane enzymes.",Bioinformatics,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11095-025-03822-6,1
"This study investigated the relationship between ferroptosis related genes and the prognosis of gastric cancer patients. Gene expression and corresponding clinical data were obtained from the TCGA database. Differentially expressed genes in gastric cancer were identified using R software, and prognostic-related genes were screened using univariate Cox regression analysis. Prognostic genes related to ferroptosis were determined using a Venn diagram. A prognostic model was constructed using LASSO-Cox regression analysis. Additionally, the expression of DUSP1 in gastric cancer was validated through immunohistochemistry, Western blot, and qRT-PCR. The impact of DUSP1 on ferroptosis was analyzed by measuring iron and lipid content in gastric cancer cell lines. A total of 407 gastric cancer patients were included as the training cohort. Fifteen prognostic genes related to ferroptosis were identified, and an 11-gene prognostic model was constructed. Risk scores were calculated for each patient, revealing that the overall survival rate was higher in the low-risk group compared to the high-risk group. ROC curves, PCA plots, and Kaplan-Meier survival curves demonstrated the model’s efficacy in predicting 5-year survival rates (AUC = 0.716). Increased DUSP1 expression, correlated with higher Fe2+ and lipid ROS levels, was observed in gastric cancer cells with increasing Erastin concentration. The prognostic model effectively predicts gastric cancer patient outcomes. DUSP1 is lowly expressed in gastric cancer tissues and is associated with malignancy and metastasis, playing a role in ferroptosis in gastric cancer cells.",Bioinformatics,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12013-024-01634-w,1
"Coronary microvascular dysfunction serves as one of the etiological factors for ischemic heart disease and represents a novel therapeutic direction for coronary artery diseases; however, the research on its pathogenesis remains inconsistent. This study aims to explore the single-cell gene expression profiles in rats with coronary microvascular dysfunction using single-cell RNA sequencing, with a particular focus on the in-depth analysis of endothelial cell gene expression characteristics. By establishing a rat model of coronary microvascular dysfunction, we collected cardiac apical tissue to prepare single-cell suspensions and further analyzed them using bioinformatics methods. From a total of 55,419 cells, we identified 28 distinct cell clusters, with endothelial cells and fibroblasts being the predominant cell types. Compared to the NC group, the proportion of endothelial cells in the CMD group was significantly reduced, while the number of fibroblasts was significantly increased. Through further analysis of the endothelial cells, we classified them into normal phenotype endothelial cells, mesenchymal phenotype endothelial cells, proliferative phenotype endothelial cells, and lymphatic endothelial cells, with mesenchymal and proliferative endothelial cells originating from normal phenotype endothelial cells. Additionally, the CMD group exhibited an increase in immune cells, enhanced inflammatory response, and increased oxidative stress. These findings may provide novel potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of Coronary microvascular dysfunction.",Bioinformatics,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1038/s41598-025-85318-2,1
"BackgroundChondrosarcoma, a rare and heterogeneous malignant bone tumor, presents significant clinical challenges due to its complex molecular underpinnings and limited treatment options. In this study, we employ single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and bioinformatics analyses to delineate cell subtypes, decipher signaling networks, and identify gene expression patterns, thereby providing novel insights into potential therapeutic targets and their implications in cancer biology.MethodsscRNA-seq was performed on both clinical and experimental chondrosarcoma samples. Dimensionality reduction techniques (UMAP/t-SNE) were used to cluster cell subtypes, followed by Gene Ontology (GO) and pathway analyses to elucidate their biological functions. Cell–cell interaction networks, including the MIF signaling network, were reconstructed to map intercellular communications. Pseudotime analysis charted differentiation trajectories, while machine learning models evaluated the classification accuracy of gene expression patterns. GSEA was conducted to identify state-specific differential expression profiles.ResultsOver ten distinct cell subtypes were identified, including endothelial cells, fibroblasts, and epithelial cells. Key signaling pathways, such as TGF-beta signaling, focal adhesion, and actin cytoskeleton regulation, were found to mediate intercellular interactions. The MIF signaling network underscored the critical roles of immune cells within the tumor microenvironment. Pseudotime analysis revealed dynamic differentiation states, while state-specific gene expression patterns emerged from GSEA. Machine learning models demonstrated robust classification performance across training and external validation datasets.ConclusionsThis comprehensive analysis uncovers the cellular heterogeneity and complex intercellular networks in chondrosarcoma, elucidating critical molecular pathways and identifying novel therapeutic targets. By integrating gene expression, signaling networks, and advanced computational methods, this study contributes to the broader understanding of cancer biology and highlights the potential for precision medicine strategies in treating chondrosarcoma.",Bioinformatics,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12672-025-02931-3,1
"Spermatogenesis is a complex process related to male infertility. Till now, the critical genes and specific mechanisms have not been elucidated clearly. Our objective was to determine the hub genes that play a crucial role in spermatogenesis by analyzing the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) present in non-obstructive azoospermia (NOA) compared to OA and normal samples using bioinformatics analysis. Four datasets, namely GSE45885, GSE45887, GSE9210 and GSE145467 were used. Functional enrichment analyses were performed on the DEGs. Hub genes were identified based on protein–protein interactions between DEGs. The expression of the hub genes was further examined in the testicular germ cell tumors from the TCGA by the GEPIA and validated by qRT-PCR in the testes of lipopolysaccharide-induced acute orchitis mice with impaired spermatogenesis. A total of 203 DEGs including 34 up-regulated and 169 down-regulated were identified. Functional enrichment analysis showed DEGs were mainly involved in microtubule motility, the process of cell growth and protein transport.PRM2, TEKT2, FSCN3, UBQLN3, SPATS1andGTSF1Lwere identified and validated as hub genes for spermatogenesis. Three of them (PRM2, FSCN3andTEKT2) were significantly down-regulated in the testicular germ cell tumors and their methylation levels were associated with the pathogenesis. In summary, the hub genes identified may be related to spermatogenesis and may act as potential therapeutic targets for NOA and testicular germ cell tumors.",Bioinformatics,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1038/s41598-023-45620-3,1
"BackgroundPulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a progressive disease of vascular remodeling characterized by persistent pulmonary arterial pressure elevation, which can lead to right heart failure and premature death. Given the complex pathogenesis and poor prognosis of PAH, the identification and investigation of biomarkers become increasingly critical for advancing further understanding of the disease.MethodsPAH-related datasets, GSE49114, GSE180169 and GSE154959, were downloaded from the publicly available GEO database. By performing WGCNA on the GSE49114 dataset, a total of 906 PAH-related key module genes were screened out. By carrying out differential analysis on the GSE180169 dataset, a total of 576 differentially expressed genes were identified. Additionally, the GSE154959 single-cell sequencing dataset was also subjected to differential analysis, leading to the identification of 34 DEGs within endothelial cells. By taking intersection of the above three groups of DEGs, five PAH-related hub genes were screened out, namely Plvap, Cyp4b1, Foxf1, H2-Ab1, and H2-Eb1, among which H2-Ab1 was selected for subsequent experiments.ResultsA SuHx mouse model was prepared using the SU5416/hypoxia method, and the successful construction of the model was evaluated through Hematoxylin-Eosin staining, hemodynamic detection, fulton index, and Western Blot (WB). The results of WB and qRT-PCR demonstrated a significant upregulation of H2-Ab1 expression in SuHx mice. Consistent with the results of bioinformatics analysis, a time-dependent increase was observed in H2-Ab1 expression in hypoxia-treated mouse pulmonary artery endothelial cells (PAECs). To investigate whether H2-Ab1 affects the development and progression of PAH, we knocked down H2-Ab1 expression in PAECs, and found that its knockdown inhibited the viability, adhesion, migration, and angiogenesis, while concurrently promoted the apoptosis of PAECs.ConclusionH2-Ab1 could regulate the proliferation, apoptosis, adhesion, migration, and angiogenesis of PAECs.",Bioinformatics,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12890-024-03156-w,1
"SHC1 plays a crucial regulatory role in various tumors, but its significance in predicting prognosis and immune response in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is yet to be determined. In this study, we conducted a bioinformatics analysis of SHC1 expression, prognosis, and immunological functions in ccRCC using multiple databases. The association between SHC1 and immune infiltration, immune escape, and immunotherapy in ccRCC was systematically established. In addition, we validated our results by western blot of tumor and adjacent-tumor samples from nine ccRCC patients, as well as three renal carcinoma cell lines compared to a normal renal cell line. Our analysis revealed that the mRNA expression level of SHC1 in ccRCC tissues is significantly higher than that in normal tissues. Consistently, western blot experiment showed ccRCC tissues and cell lines exhibit higher protein levels that normal tissues and cell lines. Importantly, patients with low expression of SHC1 demonstrated a higher survival rate, indicating that SHC1 could serve as an independent prognostic factor for predicting survival in ccRCC. Additionally, high expression of SHC1 was associated with increased severe immune cell infiltration, enhanced immune escape, and higher immunotherapy scores. Hence, SHC1 emerges as a novel and easily detectable biomarker for predicting clinical outcomes, immune escape, and immunotherapy response in patients with ccRCC.",Bioinformatics,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1038/s41598-024-70897-3,1
"In this study, we aimed to identify molecular markers associated with type II alveolar epithelial cell injury in acute lung injury (ALI) models using bioinformatics methods. The objective was to provide new insights for the diagnosis and treatment of ALI/ARDS. We downloaded RNA SEQ datasets (GSE109913, GSE179418, and GSE119123) from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and used R language package to screen differentially expressed genes (DEGs). DEGs were annotated using Gene Ontology (GO), and their pathways were analyzed using Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG). DEGs were imported into the STRING database and analyzed using Cytoscape software to determine the protein network of DEGs and calculate the top 10 nodes for the hub genes. Finally, potential therapeutic drugs for the hub genes were predicted using the DGIdb database. We identified 78 DEGs, including 70 up-regulated genes and 8 down-regulated genes. GO analysis revealed that the DEGs were mainly involved in biological processes such as granulocyte migration, response to bacterial-derived molecules, and cytokine-mediated signaling pathways. Additionally, they had cytokine activity, chemokine activity, and receptor ligand activity, and functioned in related receptor binding, CXCR chemokine receptor binding, G protein-coupled receptor binding, and other molecular functions. KEGG analysis indicated that the DEGs were mainly involved in TNF signaling pathway, IL-17 signaling pathway, NF-κB signal pathway, chemokine signal pathway, cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction signal pathway, and others. We identified eight hub genes, including IRF7, IFIT1, IFIT3, PSMB8, PSMB9, BST2, OASL2, and ZBP1, which were all up-regulated genes. We identified several hub genes of type II alveolar epithelial cells in ALI mouse models using bioinformatics analysis. These results provide new targets for understanding and treating of ALI.",Bioinformatics,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1038/s41598-023-45129-9,1
"Pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAAD) is a highly aggressive and lethal malignancy, characterized by late diagnosis, rapid progression, and poor response to conventional therapies. Altered nucleotide metabolism has recently been recognized as a critical driver of tumorigenesis, impacting cellular proliferation, invasion, and immune evasion. However, the role of specific metabolic enzymes, such as NT5M (cytosolic 5′-nucleotidase, mitochondrial), in PAAD remains poorly understood. In this study, we employed an integrated approach combining comprehensive bioinformatics analysis with systematic in vitro functional assays to investigate the multifaceted roles of NT5M in PAAD. Our investigation focused on three key aspects: (1) establishing NT5M as a novel prognostic biomarker, with lower expression levels significantly correlating with poor clinical outcomes; (2) characterizing the association between NT5M expression and tumor microenvironment (TME) features; and (3) elucidating the mechanistic role of NT5M in immune regulation within PAAD. Importantly, we discovered that NT5M downregulation is associated with increased CXCL8 expression and subsequent PD-L1 upregulation, thereby reversing immune evasion in pancreatic cancer. These findings establish NT5M as both a valuable prognostic indicator for tumor progression and a promising therapeutic target for PAAD. The identification of these interconnected pathways provides a novel strategy for enhancing the efficacy of immune checkpoint blockade therapies, potentially overcoming the current limitations in pancreatic cancer immunotherapy.",Bioinformatics,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1038/s41598-025-10098-8,1
"We review current methods and bioinformatics tools for the text complexity estimates (information and entropy measures). The search DNA regions with extreme statistical characteristics such as low complexity regions are important for biophysical models of chromosome function and gene transcription regulation in genome scale. We discuss the complexity profiling for segmentation and delineation of genome sequences, search for genome repeats and transposable elements, and applications to next-generation sequencing reads. We review the complexity methods and new applications fields: analysis of mutation hotspots loci, analysis of short sequencing reads with quality control, and alignment-free genome comparisons. The algorithms implementing various numerical measures of text complexity estimates including combinatorial and linguistic measures have been developed before genome sequencing era. The series of tools to estimate sequence complexity use compression approaches, mainly by modification of Lempel–Ziv compression. Most of the tools are available online providing large-scale service for whole genome analysis. Novel machine learning applications for classification of complete genome sequences also include sequence compression and complexity algorithms. We present comparison of the complexity methods on the different sequence sets, the applications for gene transcription regulatory regions analysis. Furthermore, we discuss approaches and application of sequence complexity for proteins. The complexity measures for amino acid sequences could be calculated by the same entropy and compression-based algorithms. But the functional and evolutionary roles of low complexity regions in protein have specific features differing from DNA. The tools for protein sequence complexity aimed for protein structural constraints. It was shown that low complexity regions in protein sequences are conservative in evolution and have important biological and structural functions. Finally, we summarize recent findings in large scale genome complexity comparison and applications for coronavirus genome analysis.",Bioinformatics,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12551-023-01140-y,1
"BackgroundThe safety of food grains is crucial for human health. Hexaconazole, Propiconazole, and Prothioconazole are widely used triazole fungicides primarily employed in agriculture for the control of plant diseases, aiming to enhance crop yield and quality.ObjectiveThis research aims to elucidate the core toxic targets and underlying molecular mechanisms of brain and liver damage induced by exposure to the three fungicides through network toxicology combined with molecular docking and bioinformatics data analysis.Method and resultsToxicity analysis through the ADMETlab database showed that the toxicity of the three fungicides was mainly associated with neurotoxicity and liver injury. Systematically utilizing GeneCards, OMIM and other databases and through Cytoscape tools, we identified potential and core targets (includingEGFR,CASP3,ESR1,PPARG,TP53,HSP90AA1, andPTGS2) associated with fungicides and brain injury or liver injury. GO and KEGG enrichment analyses indicate that these targets are associated with pathways related to cancer, the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, organic cyclic compounds, and organic nitrogen compounds. Molecular docking simulations conducted using AutoDock confirmed the high-affinity binding interactions between the fungicides and key target proteins.ConclusionsThis study provides a theoretical foundation for understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the neurotoxicity and hepatotoxicity induced by Hexaconazole, Propiconazole, and Prothioconazole, while establishing a foundational framework for the development of prevention and treatment strategies related to triazole pesticide-associated brain and liver injuries.

"BackgroundAcute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a highly aggressive hematologic malignancy with poor prognosis and high relapse rates. While the TNFAIP8 gene family (TNFAIP8, TNFAIP8L1, TNFAIP8L2, and TNFAIP8L3) is implicated in cancer and immune regulation, its role in AML remains unclear. This study utilized bioinformatics analyses to investigate their expression, prognostic significance, genetic alterations, and immune associations in AML.MethodsThe expression levels and clinical significance of TNFAIP8 family genes in AML were evaluated using UCSC XENA databases. Kaplan–Meier survival analysis was performed to assess overall survival (OS) differences, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were utilized to evaluate the prognostic predictive abilities of these genes. Genetic alterations were analyzed using the cBioPortal platform, while immune infiltration was examined through ssGSEA and Spearman correlation analysis. Functional enrichment analysis of co-expressed genes was conducted using the KEGG and GO databases.ResultsTNFAIP8, TNFAIP8L1, TNFAIP8L2, and TNFAIP8L3 were significantly overexpressed in AML tissues compared to normal tissues (P < 0.001). However, Kaplan–Meier survival analysis revealed no significant association between their expression levels and OS in AML patients. ROC curve analysis showed that TNFAIP8L2 had the highest predictive accuracy (AUC = 1.000) among the family members, followed by TNFAIP8L1 (AUC = 0.728), TNFAIP8 (AUC = 0.709), and TNFAIP8L3 (AUC = 0.629). Clinicopathological analysis indicated that TNFAIP8 and TNFAIP8L1 expressions were associated with poor cytogenetic risk, while TNFAIP8L3 expression correlated strongly with elevated bone marrow blasts (P < 0.001). Mutation analysis revealed a low frequency of genetic alterations, with TNFAIP8L1 being the only gene with mutations in 0.53% of cases. Immune infiltration analysis demonstrated that TNFAIP8 and TNFAIP8L3 were positively correlated with myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), while TNFAIP8L1 expression was associated with natural killer (NK) cell enrichment.ConclusionTNFAIP8 family genes play distinct roles in AML pathogenesis and immune regulation. TNFAIP8L2 shows promise as a prognostic biomarker, while TNFAIP8 and TNFAIP8L1 may indicate adverse cytogenetic risk.

"Data science education in Japan extends from elementary to high school students. However, some studies show that this has not enhanced interest or curiosity in data science. Therefore, gamification appears to be an efficient method for encouraging high school students’ interest in data science, with research indicating that video games are effective in education. Given this, we developed a battle-type game “Data Monsters” to improve junior high school and university students’ interest in data science. The effectiveness of Data Monsters was evaluated using a questionnaire, and data analysis and utilization tests were assessed before and after playing this game. A total of 20 participants, comprising junior high school to university students, who were unfamiliar with data science, joined the experiment. The results of each test demonstrated that the developed game was useful in improving students’ understanding of mathematical terms and their interest in data science. The average score of their interest increased by 1.37 points. In addition, the average score of students’ data analysis and utilization skills improved by 0.96 and 0.71 points, respectively.

"Although several studies investigate the ideas of students and teachers about Nature of Science (NOS) in elementary and secondary education, research on NOS understanding of young children and early years teachers (in- and pre-service) is rather limited. However, an insufficient NOS understanding of the latter may affect their instructional choices and their students’ NOS understanding. Moreover, including NOS in early years education may contribute to forming the basis for comprehending scientific concepts, acquiring scientific skills, and shaping positive attitudes towards science. Considering the above, we investigated the understanding of pre-service early years teachers about specific aspects of NOS. We administered a questionnaire with closed-ended and open-ended items to 97 pre-service early years teachers in order to trace their understanding of specific NOS aspects such as the role of creativity and imagination in science, the provisional nature of scientific knowledge, the integration of science within socio-cultural contexts, and the distinction between observation and inference in science. According to our findings, the participants expressed a rather insufficient understanding of NOS, giving few informed answers. Concerning different aspects, the aspect of creativity in science was found to be the most challenging for them. On the contrary, the aspect of the provisional nature of scientific knowledge was found to be the most comprehensible.

"This paper is based on a reflection of my interest in science, views about science, science teacher education, and science teaching experiences. Using the self-study, I explored how my training in science education has influenced my interest in teaching science using inquiry-based learning. Anutoethnography approach was systematically used to describe and analyze my experiences through the transformation to identify my professional learning identity. Multiple data sources from academic learning, teaching experiences, workshops, and documents from lesson plans and curricula documents enabled me to understand my professional practice and build professional identity. The findings showed that teachers professional learning positively impacts their beliefs about IBL. Teachers with positive attitudes toward adopting IBL approach as facilitators are supported by their previous learning experiences. Teachers experiences in adopting IBL are influenced by their professional growth through their learning experiences and involvement in a collaborating learning community. in addition, teacher-reflective learning enables them to develop new PCK that allows them to use prior experiences to adopt strategies that could motivate students to engage in learning activities that enhance their thinking to solve problems in their inquiry lessons. Further, classroom discussions and reflections with students impact their understanding of concepts for knowledge construction. These findings suggest that engaging students in inquiry learning can be an effective way for teachers to develop their competencies to teach science, especially when responding to students questions.

"Despite being present in classrooms with Christian students, biblical knowledge is often silenced by teachers or students themselves, without exploring the possibilities it can establish with teaching and learning themes. In this article, we present the findings of a qualitative empirical investigation carried out in Brazil, which had the following objectives: 1. Interpreting the relationships between the ethnobiological knowledge present in the Bible and the scientific knowledge presented by science teachers; 2. Pointing out implications and propositions for science teaching that is sensitive to cultural diversity, including Christianity. The results indicate that there is knowledge in the Bible that allows for intercultural dialogue in science classes on various topics such as the solar system, geology, origin of the universe, origin of man, health, human physiology, and ecology. This knowledge establishes relationships of similarities and differences with school and academic scientific knowledge. We propose a didactic sequence for intercultural dialogue with the ethnobiological knowledge of the Bible. We suggest continuing the research reported here to expand the possibilities of relationships between the Bible and science, as well as conducting new studies with pedagogical interventions using these relationships.

Science education fit for the future requires teachers who can navigate online information effectively and develop these capabilities in their students. In this study, we address the ways in which Australian preservice science teachers engage their cognitions about knowledge and knowing when searching and evaluating online information. Using concurrent think-aloud protocols we studied preservice science teachers’ cognitions while completing internet search and evaluation tasks for science lesson content on socioscientific issues. Through subsequent interviews, we captured further dimensions of participants’ knowledge and understanding of search and evaluation processes. We contribute new knowledge by providing a novel conceptual framework used for data analysis and empirical evidence about the cognitions (aims, value, ideals, and relied upon processes) that preservice science teachers engage when searching and evaluating online information. Implications for research and practice are discussed.",Materials Science,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11165-024-10214-0,2
"This work presents an object-oriented software framework for automated data extraction and question-answering from materials science literature, with a focus on alloy properties. The system leverages Google’s Gemini API to process PDF documents, extract yield strength (YS), ultimate tensile strength (UTS), elongation, and additive manufacturing process data, and structure the results into tabular form. Extracted datasets are further enhanced with property cleaning, alloy composition parsing, and conversion to atomic percentages. A companion question-answering module allows users to query the resulting tables using natural language, supported by embeddings for similarity search. Performance benchmarks show reliable extraction accuracy, robustness to challenging figures, and scalable runtime behavior. Embedding analysis reveals that alloys cluster by processing route and display smooth gradients with mechanical properties, while cosine similarity between embeddings correlates negatively with differences in YS and UTS. As a case study, the extracted Al-alloy dataset was also used in supervised learning regressors for YS and UTS, achieving R2values of ~ 0.7–0.88, demonstrating that the mined data can directly support predictive modeling. The modular design and use of API-accessible LLMs lower the barrier to adoption, making this framework broadly accessible for materials informatics.",Materials Science,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40192-025-00431-4,2
"The development of artificial intelligence (AI), particularly, data science and machine learning (ML), is revolutionizing the field of material science. Yet, some inevitable key challenges remain, including errors contained in large-scale material datasets and the overfitting of predicted temperature-dependent properties. In this work, using thermoelectric (TE) materials as an archetypal example, we firstly performed a series of rational actions to identify and discard questionable data, and obtained 92,291 data points consisting of 7295 compositions and different temperatures from the Starrydata2 database. Next, we proposed a composition-based cross-validation method to emphasize that the data points with the same compositions but different temperatures should not be split into different sets to avoid overfitting. Then, we built ML models using the gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT) method, and achieved remarkableR2values of ∼0.89, ∼0.90, and ∼0.89 on the training dataset, test dataset, and new out-of-sample experimental data published in 2023, verifying the model’s high accuracy in predicting newly available materials. Using this ML model, we carried out a large-scale evaluation of the stable materials from the Materials Project database, and Ge2Te5As2and Ge3(Te3As)2were predicted to exhibit highzTvalues. Density functional theory calculations were then executed and the calculated maximumzTvalues were 1.98 and 2.12 for n- and p-type Ge2Te5As2, and 0.58 and 0.74 for n- and p-type Ge3(Te3As)2, respectively, indicating their potential as TE materials and supporting our ML model. This work presents an example of dealing with and overcoming big data challenges in AI for materials science.",Materials Science,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40843-023-2777-2,2
"AbstractA significant number of different types of damage to structural materials, as well as various scenarios of their accumulation, up to destruction, require not only the use of a significant set of experimental methods and the methods of theoretical materials science and molecular physics, but also for developing appropriate mathematical models. These models perform two functions. On the one hand, they make it possible to give a reasonable interpretation of complicated processes, and, on the other hand, they can forecast the evolution of the material under specific operating conditions. Some features characterizing the description of material degradation and destruction based on kinetic approaches are considered.",Materials Science,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1134/S199542122470117X,2
"Chatbots are making a strong entry into education, supporting both students and teachers. This study aims to deepen the understanding of the educational use of chatbots in science education, including their advantages and limitations. A scoping review of the articles published up to January 1, 2025, was conducted following PRISMA guidelines across the Web of Science, Scopus, and ERIC databases, using search terms related to science education and chatbots. From an initial pool of 608 articles, 40 met all inclusion criteria. Most of the selected studies were exploratory (32.5%), with fewer intervention-based designs. Chatbots in science education are promising tools but are still in their early stages, and this could explain the large number of exploratory studies found. ChatGPT is the most studied and has demonstrated excellent linguistic capabilities but needs to improve its scientific accuracy and analytical skills. Tutoring students is the most commonly found application of chatbots. They also have the potential to support teachers by reducing their workload, although empirical data are needed to confirm this. Integrating Artificial Intelligence literacy and critical thinking skills into curricula, alongside comprehensive teacher professional development, is crucial for the effective and responsible use of chatbots in science education.",Materials Science,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10956-025-10260-x,2
"This research introduces a new multi-modal generative AI framework for accelerating and optimising the design of next-generation intelligent materials, which has traditionally been a time-consuming and costly discovery process. The framework includes an AI-based text-to-structure translator, a variational autoencoder (VAE)–based molecular structure generator, and a generative adversarial network (GAN)–based macroscopic property predictor. Integration of physics-informed constraints and interpretability ensures the physical feasibility of the designed molecules and provides insights about structure–property correlations. The high performance of the proposed AI design framework is validated with case studies on shape-memory polymers and self-healing materials, which are two crucial functionalities for soft robots and biomedical devices. The AI-designed materials are found to outperform the state-of-the-art on fundamental properties: 11.8% increase in glass transition temperature, 15.4% increase in tensile strength, 10.2% enhancement in shape recovery ratio, 8.2% improvement in self-healing efficiency, and a healing time decreased by 41.8%, which were validated through molecular dynamics simulation. The knowledge graph revealed and predicted novel correlations between molecular substructures and macroscopic properties through domain-specific competition rules. This work is the first large-scale application of AI to materials science, which significantly reduces the time and cost of discovering new intelligent materials and paves the way to rapidly innovate aerospace, biomedical engineering, and soft robotics.",Materials Science,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00170-025-14999-w,2

"Psychedelic science is haunted. A dark past, and contemporary violations, litter the field with ghosts of appropriation, abuse, and a violent war on drugs. Yet, these forms of haunting often remain unseen in discussions of the ethical aspects of psychedelic science. This manuscript explores various ways in which ghosts populate our collective and individual set and settings when it comes to psychedelic drugs, and what moral demands these ghosts might place on us. The first section examines three forms of haunting in psychedelic science. Colonial harms loom large, as a booming psychedelic industry creates scars of appropriation, biopiracy, and ecological damage. In psychedelic research contexts, various harms to participants haunt the past and present, from unethical experiments funded by MK-Ultra to current concerns related to vulnerabilities and shortcomings within ongoing clinical trials. The War on Drugs has left further damage, preventing racialized communities from feeling safe in psychedelic contexts, given enduring effects of over-policing. The next section examines demands for moral repair that have been made in response to these ghost stories. These demands, which focus on themes of acknowledgement and accountability, compensation, and listening and learning, bear a striking resemblance to discussions of reconciliation in the wake of human rights abuses. In light of these demands, the final section asks whether reconciliation is either possible or desirable in psychedelic science, or if perhaps we’re better off remaining haunted.",Materials Science,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12152-025-09622-4,2
"There is increasing interest in the use of artificial intelligence technologies, which have become a transformative force in the field of education, in educational fields that include subject areas that support lifelong learning, such as science and chemistry education. In this study, a systematic review was conducted on the use and effects of artificial intelligence applications in science and chemistry education between 2014 and 2024. As a result of the systematic review, it was seen that there was an increase in studies between 2021 and 2024. It was seen that artificial intelligence applications are mostly carried out in the field of science education. ChatGPT and conversational robots are usually used. These tools mostly impact on learning outcomes related to the learning process and researchers mostly report risks/limitations related to ethical issues in the use of AI tools in education. These applications are seen to have effects such as contributing to the online learning process of students, facilitating learning, providing multi-modal (auditory) learning environments for science/chemistry laboratory courses, providing interdisciplinary learning experiences, and encouraging personalized learning. In the reviewed studies, researchers generally emphasize ethical challenges and limitations regarding gender and racial bias, hallucinations, copyright infringement, plagiarism and biased information production, issues related to accuracy and reliability, problems with technical infrastructure and language support, and the impact of these practices on human decision-making processes and writing skills. As a result, determining and presenting ethical issues regarding the use of artificial intelligence tools in science and chemistry education and increasing the awareness of students and teachers about the conscious use of these tools will be an important step.",Materials Science,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s44217-025-00622-3,2
